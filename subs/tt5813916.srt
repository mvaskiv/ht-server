1
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:05,612
We dedicate this film to
NCOs like Omer Halisdemir.

2
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:09,891
To officers like Harun Kilinç.

3
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:14,132
To specialists like
Yunus Emre Uçar as well as.

4
00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:19,412
The Turkish Armed Forces
and all of it's selfless soldiers.

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,074
Everyone is intimidated by a shark. Become

00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:52,832
This is Black Sheep 44-1 Niner.

7
00:00:53,032 --> 00:00:56,512
Bandits marked. Reference south.

8
00:00:56,912 --> 00:01:00,032
Black Sheep 2, angels 15.
Alpha Check.

9
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:05,672
Affirm. Estimated mark 4 miles.

10
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:08,272
Everybody out of burners.

11
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:15,071
Mark clear.

12
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,632
Permission to splash target.

13
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:22,391
Break break, Black Sheep 44-1.
This is Turkish AWACS Güney.

14
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,392
NATO friendlies in sector.

15
00:01:27,632 --> 00:01:31,151
Break break, Black Sheep 44-1.
This is Turkish AWACS Güney.

16
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,152
NATO friendlies in sector.

17
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,951
Stand by 2. Come in, Güney.

18
00:01:39,272 --> 00:01:43,792
Operation near the mountain.
OPSEC may be compromised. Please comply.

00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:54,512
THE MOUNTAIN II

20
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:46,072
As a part of the kuffar coalition.

21
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:54,112
Having interviewed civilians.

22
00:02:58,631 --> 00:03:01,432
And filmed idolaters.

23
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:03,671
I regret...

24
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,592
Regret...

25
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:15,311
Nothing.

26
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,192
I regret nothing!

27
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,192
The world must know these animals...

28
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:27,791
Do it!

29
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,590
Do it you scum! Do it!

30
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:32,111
You think I would give you my fear?
Do it!

31
00:03:54,272 --> 00:03:55,391
The wind

32
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:57,832
is intensity 2, from 3 o'clock.

33
00:03:58,832 --> 00:04:00,671
Distance 800 meters.

34
00:04:00,712 --> 00:04:02,552
A taut bow is pulled...

35
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,992
To unleash the arrow.

36
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:18,872
Ms. Balaban?

37
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:21,272
Ms. Balaban, are you alright?

38
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:26,752
Are you hurt anywhere?

39
00:05:27,712 --> 00:05:29,951
- What?
- Are you hurt?

40
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:31,871
No.

41
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:38,192
Please come with us.
We're here for you.

42
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,712
Sir, we need to head to the village.
We are exposed here.

43
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:45,512
Mustafa, give me time.

44
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:47,552
Five minutes tops, sir.

45
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:50,672
Eşref, buy us time.
Drop anyone armed in the alleys.

46
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:53,392
Earman in the alleys.

47
00:05:53,432 --> 00:05:55,510
- Who are you?
- Special Forces, ma'am.

48
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:57,112
Combat search and rescue.

49
00:05:57,152 --> 00:05:59,871
Oguz, Bekir.
Find Ceyda's civilian outfit.

50
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:02,591
Baybars, gather mags.
We're leaving.

51
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:04,672
Where?

52
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,511
Home, Ms. Balaban.
We're going home.

53
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:36,872
Here we go again, into the shit...

54
00:06:39,752 --> 00:06:41,192
Join me only if you want it.

55
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:44,111
I'll never be accepted.

56
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:46,552
My leg aches even when jacking off.

57
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:48,311
Do you want it or not?

58
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:50,831
Jacking off?

59
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:53,230
Bekir...

60
00:06:53,231 --> 00:06:55,751
C'mon just drink.
Less talk more sips.

61
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:00,992
Whatever happened to that girl?

62
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:04,472
You know, the one you told me
about at the relay station?

63
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:07,072
Oh man, you remember that...

64
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:09,472
She got married two months ago.

65
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:29,392
We never had a girl whose voice
rang like toasted glass.

66
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:30,751
You're drunk again.

67
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:33,752
You know what? We never
really forget someone.

68
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,472
We carry lost ones behind our
backs like sacks of memories.

69
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:39,032
We're like porters, man.

70
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:42,311
We pray, we cuss, we endure.

71
00:07:42,352 --> 00:07:44,752
But those memories prowl
in our heads like foxes.

72
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:48,232
The dead and lost loves are the same.

73
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:50,312
We only ever reminisce about them.

74
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,832
Sometimes, in my dreams,
I see Captain Yaşar.

75
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:56,312
I see his final glance at me.

76
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,631
There is worry there,

77
00:08:02,752 --> 00:08:04,792
but not for himself, you know?

78
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:08,272
He's afraid for me instead.

79
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:12,152
What would he have said at this?

80
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,711
If he ever heard we were
signing up for Special Forces trials...

81
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:17,471
First he would lovingly pat our backs.

82
00:08:18,112 --> 00:08:19,912
Then he'd tell a dirty joke.

83
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:22,192
After that he would
probably cuss us out.

84
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:24,272
Probably.

85
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:27,671
Oguz.

86
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:32,512
We're the guys Sergeant Kemal and he
died to let live. We need to be worthy.

87
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:34,751
Otherwise we're trash.

88
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,272
To the unforgotten.

89
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:51,551
Arif, what do you see?

90
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:53,872
Iraq, sir...

91
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:57,272
The land of betrayal and enmity.

92
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:09,232
We're 24 km southeast of the mountain.

93
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:11,231
They will be here soon.

94
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:13,192
What's our ammo status?

95
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:15,592
We gathered what we could
but they are all AK rounds sir.

96
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:20,832
These men were reinforcements.
Real assault troops are south.

97
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,911
We need to reach the landing
zone as soon as possible.

98
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:32,470
- Bekir?
- Yes, sir.

99
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,232
Get an AK, we can booby trap it.

100
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:36,191
Why just me?

101
00:09:39,272 --> 00:09:40,472
Why?

102
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:45,352
My team was also there.
Why just me?

103
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:49,631
My cameraman Phillip,
producer Nechirwan could

104
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,992
have been here with us, alive.

105
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:57,791
Because they weren't Turks...
that's why you did nothing.

106
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:01,912
It is not that simple Ms. Balaban.

107
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,912
Ceyda will do. No need for Ms.

108
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:09,392
Don't worry, I won't keep reminding
you of your racist preferences.

109
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:11,912
Remind us if you like.

110
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:15,071
I can't endanger the lives of my men
for those who aren't Turkish citizens.

111
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:16,711
- Do you know who I am...
- Oh we do.

112
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:19,552
Your views, your articles, your
opposition, they don't concern us.

113
00:10:19,592 --> 00:10:22,151
- A mission is a mission. Bekir?
- Yes sir.

114
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:24,191
You scout ahead with Oguz.

115
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:25,952
We leave from the rear with Ceyda.

116
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,111
We head for the villages 10 km west.

117
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:29,312
Keep your eyes peeled.

118
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:32,032
Ceyda wears my helmet and
the kevlar vest Eşref brought.

119
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:34,232
If she takes it off, make her wear it.

120
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,232
Are we all set?

121
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:28,472
How is your ear?

122
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:31,832
I have reconstruction surgery
in two weeks sir.

123
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,792
Are you two kidding me?

124
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:40,952
Just get your honorable discharge.
Why are you still in service?

125
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:43,232
One of you has a platinum shoulder.

126
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:47,111
The other one half lame.
What trials, what training?

127
00:11:47,432 --> 00:11:49,952
Sir, if you only let us
explain the situation...

128
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:51,952
I don't think you understand.

129
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:55,712
We have no use for damaged men
who might risk their teams.

130
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:58,631
Say we put you in, what do
we do with your friend?

131
00:11:58,672 --> 00:12:00,512
Is he going to cook behind enemy lines?

132
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:02,831
I'm just about to cuss.

133
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:04,072
What did you say?

134
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:05,992
- Selim.
- Attention!

135
00:12:07,312 --> 00:12:09,431
- I will take it from here.
- Yes, sir.

136
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:23,272
At ease.

137
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:29,032
Units here are not about individual men,

138
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:30,911
but about cohesiveness.

139
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,271
If one man falters,
the entire team may fall.

140
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:36,671
That is why old wounds are important.

141
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,512
'The short-termer has no rifle,
and the other is Bekir.'

142
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,112
Yaşar's last words to me.

143
00:12:50,632 --> 00:12:53,632
- Are your two years up?
- They will be in two months sir.

144
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:56,392
Bekir becomes a specialist,
myself a Lieutenant.

145
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:01,352
Yaşar was my classmate.

146
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:03,632
My friend.

147
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:08,032
If they had send us to you
instead of HQ,

148
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:11,231
I would gladly have died to avenge him.

149
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,872
You want me to throw the kids
he saved into the flames.

150
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,671
My answer is no.

151
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,272
They are not kids anymore sir.

152
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:29,992
One wakes up gasping in the night

153
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:34,072
to nightmares of Sergeant Kemal
whispering his wife's name as he dies.

154
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:35,432
Leyla.

155
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:38,152
The other wants to dedicate himself
to a cause for the first time.

156
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,871
They might be many things sir,
but they are not kids.

157
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:45,392
If they died to make us live,

158
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,072
then let us live, sir.

159
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,032
Let us make others live.

160
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:55,432
You have two months.
Prepare well.

161
00:13:56,032 --> 00:13:58,271
The trials and classes will be hell.

162
00:14:02,831 --> 00:14:03,832
Way to go!

163
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:13,151
There aren't real deserts you know.

164
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:15,071
They are all wind erosion.

165
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:17,111
Huh? Eurovision?

166
00:14:17,672 --> 00:14:20,312
Man, use the internet once for
something other than porn.

167
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:22,072
Just kidding bro.

168
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:24,832
Here we are, alone again.

169
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:27,271
This is my fucking destiny.
My fate.

170
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:30,671
Snow, winter, desert, sand...
Death and Oguz.

171
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:33,430
I wish you would nag with the
Lt. Colonel nearby, just once.

172
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:34,912
Oh I'm sorry, 'sir'.

173
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:37,672
I mean I don't pull rank because
it's you.

174
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:44,072
Tell me, do you think it was worth
risking 7 national treasures for Ceyda?

175
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:46,792
Bekir Özbey, national treasure.

176
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:48,911
Answer me you dolt.

177
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:51,911
I don't know.

178
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:56,552
Well if you ask me she can
be a little more respectful.

179
00:14:58,352 --> 00:14:59,912
Bekir...

180
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:04,511
662 Tamu Cizre, this is Storm Bringer.

181
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:07,511
- The package is safe, over.
- T-155's are ready sir.

182
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:09,112
We can illuminate the area, over.

183
00:15:09,152 --> 00:15:11,351
Still undetected, no needs, over.

184
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:13,991
Copy that Storm Bringer, on standby.

185
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:16,871
Where are you from, Ms. Balaban?

186
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:19,472
Is this you tactic?

187
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:21,791
Excuse me?

188
00:15:22,391 --> 00:15:25,271
The others are robots.
I'm a package.

189
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:27,392
Are you supposed to be the kind one?

190
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,072
I wish the soldiers I train would
hear of what you just said.

191
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:38,711
I believe this belongs to you.

192
00:15:39,191 --> 00:15:41,992
Other than us, you can
photograph anything you like.

193
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,952
You don't have to be nice.

194
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:49,871
And you don't have to be grateful.

195
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:52,192
I'm not.

196
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:54,071
I know.

197
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:05,711
I'm from Milas.

198
00:16:38,392 --> 00:16:41,312
They executed everyone, even children.

199
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,152
Sons of whores.

200
00:16:57,911 --> 00:16:59,432
Where are we?

201
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:01,552
36-25 to 41-75.

202
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:04,232
These are Yezidi grasslands.

203
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:16,631
This is new sir.
2-3 hours.

204
00:17:17,752 --> 00:17:20,272
They don't struggle during killing.

205
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:24,352
Fathers lie to their children so
that it's over quickly.

206
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:27,272
Otherwise they torture those who resist.
Pull nails... gouge eyes...

207
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:29,831
Their only fault is to exist.

208
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,391
According to their killers, Yezidi
are not human, but devilspawn.

209
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:36,632
Their sin is to have a religion
the others can't understand.

210
00:17:38,552 --> 00:17:40,151
This is not our fight.

211
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:45,272
No sir. It's not.

212
00:17:45,712 --> 00:17:48,832
Because this is no fight at all.

213
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:51,112
- Sir?
- Go ahead Arif.

214
00:17:51,392 --> 00:17:52,631
They're coming.

215
00:18:03,152 --> 00:18:04,432
Let them come.

216
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:08,351
We are death's lovers.

217
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:11,272
Take off your berets.

218
00:18:11,312 --> 00:18:13,151
Take a look at them.

219
00:18:14,272 --> 00:18:16,991
Are you here for those berets?

220
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,912
From the 200 selected NCO and
officers in these trials...

221
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:25,192
...only 20 will join active duty.

222
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:27,232
But why?

223
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:29,632
What is our nature?

224
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:32,751
Are we heroes? Warriors?

225
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:34,391
Legends?

226
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:38,191
If you're seeking such things,
you're in the wrong place gentlemen.

227
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:41,192
We are nothing.
Our aim is to be forgotten...

228
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:42,551
...unknown.

229
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:45,512
Our names won't be carved into stone.

230
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:48,191
They won't sing about us.

231
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:52,832
For if we gather fame,
that means we have failed.

232
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:56,552
Our nature is to utterly serve
the Turkish people.

233
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:58,511
We are death's lovers...

234
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:00,232
...and only us...

235
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,431
...because both suffering and fear of
her must stay away from our people.

236
00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:06,511
If one day when you let out
your last breath...

237
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,432
...the only thing you see is
your blood...

238
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:10,990
...and the only thing you hear
is silence...

239
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:12,832
...know that you are not alone.

240
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:18,191
Those before you, those after
you, all of Special Forces...

241
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:20,912
...will die with you...

242
00:19:21,352 --> 00:19:23,432
...and be reborn with you.

243
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,792
- One dies...
- ...a thousand rise!

244
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:53,591
- Good luck, gentlemen.
- Sir yes sir!

245
00:20:19,672 --> 00:20:21,551
Oguz, they're coming. Oguz!

246
00:20:23,552 --> 00:20:24,832
Bekir...

247
00:20:25,912 --> 00:20:27,512
Oguz?

248
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:36,392
Oh they're here man. Oguz?

249
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:40,112
Shut up, stop using the comm.
You're gonna get us killed!

250
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:42,352
Hush damn it!

251
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:47,111
- Tamu Cizre.
- Your orders, sir.

252
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:48,911
Illuminate them.

253
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:03,352
Copy Storm Bringer.
Illuminating.

254
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:22,031
Arif.

255
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:25,391
The night births the moon.

256
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:30,232
To rise and fall.

257
00:21:39,952 --> 00:21:41,632
Mecnun moans as his blood...

258
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:45,671
...joins beloved Leyla.

259
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:10,792
These men came from the west, Mustafa.

260
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:12,992
There were none west this morning.

261
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:19,952
662 Tamu Cizre.
This is Storm Bringer.

262
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:21,232
What do you see?

263
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:24,592
Veysel, it's me, Doan.

264
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:27,310
Your orders, sir.

265
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:30,832
Kurds are exhausted north.
They can't hold. The pincer has closed.

266
00:22:30,872 --> 00:22:31,792
How many?

267
00:22:32,992 --> 00:22:34,870
The jihadis are encircling the
mountain to shut off the border.

268
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:36,352
You need to hurry.

269
00:22:37,712 --> 00:22:39,272
Sir, how many?

270
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:41,432
Two thousand.

271
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:42,872
Get out of there.

272
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:44,231
What does this mean?

273
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:46,991
This area is surrounded.

274
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,672
Such bad luck.
We're in the middle of total invasion.

275
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:51,911
Sir.

276
00:22:53,192 --> 00:22:55,432
This truck works.
We can reach the climb to the mountain.

277
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:57,711
Won't Turkey send you reinforcements?

278
00:22:57,712 --> 00:23:01,631
This is a clandestine operation.
Turkish soldiers are officially not here.

279
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:06,032
Only we can save ourselves.

280
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,792
The situation is deteriorating.

281
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:11,872
Those two thousand men, in order
to hide from American bombers...

282
00:23:11,912 --> 00:23:14,432
...will climb the mountain.
We need to find safe shelter.

283
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:18,712
There is.

284
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:22,592
There is a place...

285
00:23:25,192 --> 00:23:27,032
There is a place, gentlemen!

286
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:30,352
A dark place.

287
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,151
A place that will lend you
strength, even if you have none.

288
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:38,752
You've finished the obstacle track.

289
00:23:39,272 --> 00:23:41,552
You think you're done for, but no.

290
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:45,392
Now, together, we discover that place.

291
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:50,312
You!

292
00:23:52,112 --> 00:23:54,311
Bekir Özbey, Ankara. Your orders, sir!

293
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:57,191
- You're a wounded vet.
- Right leg, sir.

294
00:23:57,232 --> 00:23:58,631
I don't care.

295
00:23:58,912 --> 00:24:00,911
You ran the track, does it hurt?

296
00:24:00,952 --> 00:24:02,152
It does sir.

297
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,912
I don't care.
You're tired, does it limp?

298
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:07,672
A little sir.

299
00:24:07,832 --> 00:24:09,752
I don't care! Run!

300
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:13,192
Run Bekir, run! Go!

301
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:15,992
Sir, yes sir!

302
00:24:18,272 --> 00:24:20,872
That pain will be honey
during missions, Bekir!

303
00:24:20,912 --> 00:24:22,432
Your eyes will tear up!

304
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:24,311
Your teeth will ache!

305
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,632
But I'll make you find that dark place!

306
00:24:31,432 --> 00:24:33,632
The mind is formed of gears, gentlemen.

307
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:35,312
It commands the body.

308
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:38,032
The mind which has nothing to lose...

309
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:41,992
...can't push the body.
Here's something to lose, Bekir!

310
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:44,192
I'll eliminate you!

311
00:24:45,911 --> 00:24:48,832
Lungs, spleen giving up!

312
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:51,872
Platinum screws, whole body bankrupt!

313
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:58,472
But you can't go to that
dark place only for yourself.

314
00:24:58,751 --> 00:25:02,432
Bekir Özbey, if you aren't here
in 30 seconds...

315
00:25:03,112 --> 00:25:05,672
...I eliminate your friend Oguz too.

316
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:10,352
He'll back up right away...

317
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:17,192
Your creed, your race, the music you
listen to, your favorite food...

318
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,112
...doesn't matter one bit!

319
00:25:19,432 --> 00:25:21,512
Only two important things, gentlemen!

320
00:25:22,112 --> 00:25:25,030
Homeland... and the guy next to you!

321
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:27,512
You die and kill for these two things.

322
00:25:27,551 --> 00:25:31,871
If need be, your friend will
cripple his leg once again...

323
00:25:32,912 --> 00:25:36,911
...but he will never
let his friend down!

324
00:25:57,712 --> 00:26:00,112
Your old wound will be a
privilege, Bekir.

325
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:03,791
Every day you'll get
electo-physical therapy.

326
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:06,832
You will weep from pain, understood?

327
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,872
Yes, sir.

328
00:26:08,912 --> 00:26:11,351
You think it's over rookies?

329
00:26:13,432 --> 00:26:15,071
On your feet!

330
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,032
Into the lake up to your chest.

331
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:24,232
Sponges will not touch the water.

332
00:26:24,592 --> 00:26:26,951
We are here until dawn, guys!

333
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:29,231
Your body temperature will fall.

334
00:26:29,432 --> 00:26:32,392
When the shivering starts
and suddenly stops...

335
00:26:32,432 --> 00:26:34,312
...know that you are freezing.

336
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:39,512
Don't get wasted, get out and
be eliminated.

337
00:26:40,271 --> 00:26:42,992
Gentlemen, we will check every
sponge in the morning.

338
00:26:43,031 --> 00:26:45,992
One drop of water when squeezed,
and you'll still be eliminated.

339
00:26:46,991 --> 00:26:49,150
Oh sir, thank you, but I'm not
really a tea guy.

340
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:50,831
I'd drink some Turkish coffee though.

341
00:26:50,872 --> 00:26:54,431
- Wow sir, no tea for us?
- Come here and have some, Oguz.

342
00:26:54,472 --> 00:26:57,512
Sir if you wouldn't mind, you can bring
it here. The water is beautiful.

343
00:26:57,712 --> 00:27:01,112
Come here sir, we'll warm you up.

344
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:03,272
Looks like you want to run again Bekir.

345
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:05,992
No sir, I just want to warm up.

346
00:27:06,352 --> 00:27:08,231
Love of the homeland will warm
you, Bekir!

347
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:14,591
You are thunderbolts, rookies!

348
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:16,751
You are avalanches!

349
00:27:17,072 --> 00:27:19,312
Whirlpools!

350
00:27:19,552 --> 00:27:21,632
The bottom of the sea...

351
00:27:22,312 --> 00:27:24,431
...depths of the earth...

352
00:27:24,472 --> 00:27:26,672
...even the highest place in the
skies...

353
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,232
...is your home!

354
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,512
You will be afraid!

355
00:27:30,911 --> 00:27:32,392
Fear is good.

356
00:27:32,872 --> 00:27:34,672
Fear will keep you alive.

357
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:39,832
But not fear of heights...

358
00:27:40,751 --> 00:27:43,391
...because eagles don't fear heights!

359
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:51,311

What is this place, exactly?

369
00:29:27,191 --> 00:29:29,392
Tomb of an Akkadian king, named Sargon.

370
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,871
Take Baybars and Eşref.

371
00:29:31,912 --> 00:29:34,791
You have command.
We need to shelter there.

372
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:36,152
Yes sir.

373
00:29:38,272 --> 00:29:39,152
Baybars.

374
00:29:45,592 --> 00:29:48,712
Everybody finish their meals.
We join them in ten minutes.

375
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:52,191
Why did they want you to rescue me?

376
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:53,351
Does it matter?

377
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,592
Throughout my career I've
written articles opposing you.

378
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:57,791
Good fucking job.

379
00:29:59,072 --> 00:30:00,232
Bekir.

380
00:30:02,152 --> 00:30:02,951
Forgive him.

381
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:07,631
Special Forces took him out of the
fight, but not the fight out of him.

382
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:11,392
It's alright. I'd prefer you
your thoughts.

383
00:30:11,432 --> 00:30:13,711
Our thought, is our mission.

384
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,991
And that is to get Ceyda
Balaban, out of Iraq.

385
00:30:15,992 --> 00:30:17,552
- That's all?
- It is.

386
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:20,032
So Turkey will idly watch
this barbarity.

387
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,032
Those who suffer here were once
a part of us.

388
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:27,191
If we warred for all our parts, we'd
need to drive tanks to Altai Mountains.

389
00:30:27,232 --> 00:30:29,711
What happens here is not war,
it's a crime against humanity.

390
00:30:35,912 --> 00:30:39,952
Am I supposed to shut up and remain
silently grateful because you saved me?

391
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:41,312
Nobody wants you grateful.

392
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:44,752
But you should respect those who
volunteered into this shit, for you.

393
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,952
You're right. But respect for you...

394
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:49,150
...and respect for the organization
you serve are different things.

395
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:50,512
Give me a break.

396
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:55,032
Go tell that to the sheep who lock up
soldiers and then declare them heroes.

397
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:56,951
Blood and life.

398
00:30:57,992 --> 00:30:59,551
That's what we offer here.

399
00:30:59,552 --> 00:31:00,551
Bekir, enough.

400
00:31:03,232 --> 00:31:05,512
Bombardment will soon begin, pack up.

401
00:33:45,752 --> 00:33:46,712
Eşref!

402
00:33:47,552 --> 00:33:49,432
He can take care of himself, go!

403
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:01,592
C4. Basic Semtex 1A.

404
00:34:02,552 --> 00:34:03,671
Find the fuse.

405
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:33,392
Found.

406
00:34:33,592 --> 00:34:35,752
- No backup trigger.
- Same here.

407
00:34:36,671 --> 00:34:38,111
We ready?

408
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:01,552
FG 1, this is FG 2.

409
00:35:02,672 --> 00:35:04,631
The tomb is clear, waiting for you.

410
00:35:31,432 --> 00:35:32,711
Not interested.

411
00:35:33,872 --> 00:35:35,072
What?

412
00:35:35,111 --> 00:35:36,311
Not interested in what?

413
00:35:36,352 --> 00:35:39,832
In what you're doing. I don't care.
I'm here to buy books.

414
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:43,071
Since you are you prepared to
be this defensive...

415
00:35:43,072 --> 00:35:46,511
Am I under attack? Never mind,
don't answer that, no need.

416
00:35:46,552 --> 00:35:48,472
I really am not interested.

417
00:35:49,151 --> 00:35:52,151
Do all guys who approach you
give up this easily?

418
00:35:52,391 --> 00:35:54,352
Unless they are shameless, sure.

419
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,792
I have this theory.

420
00:35:58,832 --> 00:36:02,632
In essence, all men are actually
invaders.

421
00:36:02,672 --> 00:36:04,153
Women on the other hand, are castles.

422
00:36:04,432 --> 00:36:06,431
One aims to conquer and occupy,
proving himself.

423
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:09,752
The other wants to remain secure
and repel the onslaught.

424
00:36:10,912 --> 00:36:12,311
So romantic.

425
00:36:12,352 --> 00:36:14,552
But then there are some invaders...

426
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:17,272
...so interesting and so original...

427
00:36:17,632 --> 00:36:19,991
...that the castle decides...

428
00:36:20,272 --> 00:36:22,271
...to open its gates without resistance.

429
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:25,552
And you think you're one of
these interesting invaders?

430
00:36:26,152 --> 00:36:28,151
You aren't doing great, let me tell you.

431
00:36:28,871 --> 00:36:30,271
Would you like to have some coffee?

432
00:36:32,111 --> 00:36:33,232
I also have a theory.

433
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:37,712
That ultimately you are looking
for a nanny, and not a lover.

434
00:36:38,552 --> 00:36:39,512
Possible.

435
00:36:39,551 --> 00:36:42,352
That's not so enjoyable for
us women, though.

436
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:47,432
Why specifically Special Forces?

437
00:36:48,191 --> 00:36:50,672
There was a feeling I had during combat.

438
00:36:50,951 --> 00:36:52,631
An awareness.

439
00:36:55,592 --> 00:36:58,232
A moment where the true value of
life just hit me.

440
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:00,071
Turtle.

441
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:03,032
- Turtle?
- I mean a turtle personality.

442
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:04,952
Because I'm green?

443
00:37:05,231 --> 00:37:08,552
Think of a turtle.
Crossing the road.

444
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:12,112
It doesn't care about the cars.
It thinks the shell will protect it.

445
00:37:12,152 --> 00:37:14,512
But in reality, it's fragile.
Can be crushed at any second.

446
00:37:14,711 --> 00:37:17,752
Turtle personalities don't really
care about what happens to them.

447
00:37:17,951 --> 00:37:20,552
A wise woman would stay away
from such a damaged man.

448
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:22,511
I should just get up and leave.

449
00:37:22,712 --> 00:37:24,311
Why don't you?

450
00:37:25,072 --> 00:37:26,432
How long until your first mission?

451
00:37:26,951 --> 00:37:29,351
Assuming I pass the trials...

452
00:37:31,112 --> 00:37:32,632
...five more years.

453
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:35,711
How long do you need me for?

454
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:43,312
Check it.

455
00:37:50,152 --> 00:37:51,832
You said Akkadian...

456
00:37:52,352 --> 00:37:54,472
...but face is Alexander the Great.

457
00:37:55,912 --> 00:37:58,832
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
you're a history expert.

458
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:01,592
Somewhere my college professor
is laughing.

459
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:04,312
Load it.

460
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:09,752
Sargon was a king who lived
4000 years ago.

461
00:38:10,232 --> 00:38:14,072
Successive civilizations built
on top of their ruins.

462
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:18,472
Sumerians, Egyptians, Persians,
Babylonians, Greeks.

463
00:38:18,512 --> 00:38:20,231
All the way to our present day.

464
00:38:20,392 --> 00:38:23,591
Some built tombs, some placed mosaics.

465
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:25,712
Some drank kymyz.

466
00:38:27,752 --> 00:38:29,992
To you, all soldiers are noble.

467
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:32,712
But you see, all of those
civilizations also had soldiers.

468
00:38:33,232 --> 00:38:36,151
In the end they fought, and killed
each other for more and more.

469
00:38:36,152 --> 00:38:38,032
They still do.

470
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:43,952
Is that how you justify your
hate of the military?

471
00:38:46,352 --> 00:38:48,791
By placing blame of war on only
soldiers?

472
00:38:49,192 --> 00:38:50,432
Again.

473
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:54,791
We don't think all soldiers are noble.

474
00:38:57,551 --> 00:39:00,272
Only those who serve their people.

475
00:39:03,712 --> 00:39:05,831
What good will learning this do for me?

476
00:39:05,872 --> 00:39:07,472
Hopefully nothing.

477
00:39:08,392 --> 00:39:10,312
Have you ever killed someone?

478
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:15,032
How does it feel?

479
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:18,911
It's not a feeling.

480
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:25,432
It's a stain.

481
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:41,392
Get ready.

482
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:44,231
Sir, I'll carry you.

483
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:47,111
I will sir! I'll carry you!

484
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,791
Oguz, wake up! Oguz!

485
00:39:57,232 --> 00:39:59,111
You'll take my rifle.

486
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:02,831
This is a dangerous place, Oguz.

487
00:40:02,872 --> 00:40:08,072
When I'm about to fall asleep at night,
I always wake up and look around me.

488
00:40:08,552 --> 00:40:11,032
I'm human too.
I feel fear as well.

489
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:17,872
One dies! A thousand rises!

490
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:28,672
Oguz?

491
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:33,512
The water's freezing. Are you alright?

492
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,992
Don't do this to yourself.
Come with me.

493
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:38,392
I'm okay here.

494
00:40:38,432 --> 00:40:40,912
This training will devastate you.

495
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:49,912
You remember stuff you're supposed
to forget and internalize it. Don't.

496
00:41:00,632 --> 00:41:02,512
When they saved us...

497
00:41:05,032 --> 00:41:07,952
...they thought I did what I did
because of bravery.

498
00:41:08,872 --> 00:41:11,951
As if I were defiant before the
sniper who was shooting at us.

499
00:41:15,992 --> 00:41:17,512
That's a lie.

500
00:41:18,872 --> 00:41:20,632
I was depleted.

501
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:23,072
I lost.

502
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:28,432
I just didn't want to leave
Bekir behind.

503
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:33,352
Wanting death is a weird thing.

504
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,912
Having it be your only escape.

505
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:42,512
You kind of want to fall in the dark.

506
00:41:42,832 --> 00:41:44,872
The thought of it becomes sweet.

507
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:50,032
I still couldn't leave that mentality.

508
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:54,472
What if I died there?

509
00:41:55,031 --> 00:41:56,272
What?

510
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:59,072
Not physically.

511
00:41:59,111 --> 00:42:03,431
What if I can never regain my
enthusiasm or normality?

512
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:06,791
That is why I must go back and
face that moment once again.

513
00:42:09,752 --> 00:42:12,071
That terror and awareness has become...

514
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:18,352
...the only thing that makes me happy.

515
00:42:20,432 --> 00:42:22,712
The only thing that makes you happy?

516
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:23,992
I know, it sounds strange.

517
00:42:24,032 --> 00:42:28,991
You'll immediately talk about
men, women and relationships...

518
00:42:29,032 --> 00:42:30,832
...how you're hurt at this.

519
00:42:30,872 --> 00:42:32,632
No, I won't.

520
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:36,352
You think you're so smart.

521
00:42:37,151 --> 00:42:41,032
But being human
is not about ending fear.

522
00:42:41,432 --> 00:42:45,671
It's about accepting them,
moving forward despite them.

523
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:49,232
I fear stuff too.

524
00:42:51,272 --> 00:42:52,432
Like what?

525
00:42:52,912 --> 00:42:55,472
Like catching cold tomorrow.

526
00:43:06,872 --> 00:43:07,952
Up, up, up.

527
00:43:09,071 --> 00:43:11,032
- What now?
- Get up.

528
00:43:12,952 --> 00:43:17,672
Oh I'm sorry? I thought your only
happiness was awareness and terror?

529
00:43:17,711 --> 00:43:19,672
You're something terrible too.

530
00:43:19,712 --> 00:43:22,711
No thanks, I'm going to find myself a
normal guy. You can keep flailing.

531
00:43:22,712 --> 00:43:26,032
- Nailing?
- I said flailing, idiot.

532
00:43:28,192 --> 00:43:30,392
662 Tamu Cizre.

533
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:34,232
662 Tamu Cizre.

534
00:43:36,592 --> 00:43:38,632
662 Tamu Cizre.

535
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:43,832
- Are we too high up?
- No, sir. Must be a jammer.

536
00:43:45,352 --> 00:43:47,392
Keep trying.

537
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,991
662 Tamu Cizre.

538
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:52,031
Visual, sir.

539
00:44:12,832 --> 00:44:14,951
What will they do to the women, Ceyda?

540
00:44:16,312 --> 00:44:18,191
What do you think they'll do?

541
00:44:20,752 --> 00:44:23,032
They are on our way, sir.

542
00:44:23,272 --> 00:44:25,552
Don't get emotional.

543
00:44:26,111 --> 00:44:29,392
If we ignore this too, I'm about
to lose all emotion anyways.

544
00:44:29,672 --> 00:44:31,712
We can also head for the other peak.

545
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:36,352
What do we do, sir?

546
00:44:36,671 --> 00:44:38,431
How long have you been hungry?

547
00:44:38,432 --> 00:44:39,592
Seven, sir.

548
00:44:39,632 --> 00:44:40,551
Thirst?

549
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:41,992
Two, sir.

550
00:44:43,112 --> 00:44:45,032
Man, you guys are fucked.

551
00:44:46,712 --> 00:44:48,751
How long have being awake, rookie?

552
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:49,952
Three, sir.

553
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:54,311
Quit the trials.
This life isn't for you.

554
00:44:54,512 --> 00:44:57,392
Gentlemen, I got a big table
inside for all of you.

555
00:44:57,431 --> 00:44:59,152
Brought some delicious food.

556
00:44:59,192 --> 00:45:02,192
Like what you ask?
Buttered Iskender Kebap.

557
00:45:02,552 --> 00:45:04,192
Lamb Ca kebap.

558
00:45:04,631 --> 00:45:06,992
Ayran, tea, coffee.

559
00:45:07,031 --> 00:45:09,832
Baklava. Both walnut and
pistachio baklava.

560
00:45:09,872 --> 00:45:11,912
And of course we have what?

561
00:45:13,112 --> 00:45:14,831
Water boys, we have water.

562
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,432
I had huge ice cubes brought for you.

563
00:45:17,471 --> 00:45:21,392
When you drop them in, you will
hear them crackle, gentlemen.

564
00:45:23,231 --> 00:45:26,111
All you have to do, when we ask,
is to tell us...

565
00:45:26,152 --> 00:45:28,072
...the name on your piece of paper.

566
00:45:28,112 --> 00:45:29,152
Lie down!

567
00:45:54,071 --> 00:45:55,391
Yavuz.

568
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,791
Go get some grub.

569
00:46:00,272 --> 00:46:01,792
Sir.

570
00:46:05,351 --> 00:46:06,952
I'll cuss, sir.

571
00:46:09,632 --> 00:46:12,272
Oh no, sir, he's going to cuss!
Maybe we should skip him?

572
00:46:13,472 --> 00:46:17,312
This is torture training, skippy.
Cuss, sing, makes no difference.

573
00:46:17,351 --> 00:46:20,711
Please sir, don't have him sing.
That will be the real torture.

574
00:46:21,791 --> 00:46:24,551
Tell us the name on your piece
of paper, go eat hot food.

575
00:46:24,592 --> 00:46:27,472
Sleep like a log. Let this
suffering end, Bekir.

576
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,632
This life is not for you.

577
00:46:44,992 --> 00:46:47,471
The enemy will not offer you food.

578
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:50,831
They won't give you warm beds as
you give up!

579
00:46:50,872 --> 00:46:53,192
They won't help with the pain!

580
00:46:53,512 --> 00:46:55,112
Tell me.

581
00:46:57,712 --> 00:47:01,592
Tell me buddy.
Tell me the name, let's end this.

582
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:06,272
♪ Ah, forgive me during nighttime
As the moon crosses the sky ♪

583
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:11,672
♪ Forgive me before dawn
Right when we break up ♪

584
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:18,791
♪ For you, are the rain to my deserts ♪

585
00:47:20,351 --> 00:47:24,152
♪ You are the morning to my night ♪

586
00:47:26,111 --> 00:47:30,232
♪ You are the comrade to my life ♪

587
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:36,472
♪ The blanket to my winter ♪

588
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:55,792
- Sir, he's approaching the record.
- He will pass it too.

589
00:47:56,672 --> 00:47:59,752
35, 36.

590
00:48:04,712 --> 00:48:08,231
38, 39, 40.

591
00:48:08,272 --> 00:48:10,391
41, 42.

592
00:48:20,152 --> 00:48:22,192
These guys were forged in fire.

593
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,632
They won't give up.

594
00:48:23,672 --> 00:48:26,512
Sir, I feel so thirsty.
Can I have some more?

595
00:49:05,951 --> 00:49:08,312
I am not Superman, bullets do affect me.

596
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,072
Baybars, what about you?

597
00:49:10,912 --> 00:49:12,592
Me too sir.

598
00:49:19,592 --> 00:49:22,751
I'm Superman sir. Got one on the
leg, then became a maroon beret.

599
00:49:26,272 --> 00:49:28,352
Open your arms and run before us Bekir.

600
00:49:28,391 --> 00:49:29,992
Become cover for us.

601
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:35,072
Sing Ankaran Turgut as you run.

602
00:49:35,312 --> 00:49:37,552
Oh man, how I miss his songs.

603
00:49:50,192 --> 00:49:51,872
Arif, your target?

604
00:49:51,911 --> 00:49:53,231
3 o'clock, sir.

605
00:49:53,912 --> 00:49:55,271
If it misses, the gasoline...

606
00:49:55,712 --> 00:49:56,831
It won't miss.

607
00:49:57,832 --> 00:49:59,152
Get ready for contact.

608
00:49:59,711 --> 00:50:01,072
On three.

609
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:02,032
One.

610
00:50:02,992 --> 00:50:04,751
On point with Bekir.

611
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,872
Two.

612
00:50:09,671 --> 00:50:10,552
Three.

613
00:50:10,592 --> 00:50:13,112
Fickle is the lover,
To make hearts bleed.

614
00:50:16,832 --> 00:50:17,872
Wear your helmet!

615
00:51:05,192 --> 00:51:06,791
Sniper!

616
00:51:10,631 --> 00:51:11,831
Get down!

617
00:51:17,432 --> 00:51:19,712
Why does the poet toil,

618
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:29,552
To weave the poem.

619
00:51:40,751 --> 00:51:41,632
Are you alright?

620
00:51:41,831 --> 00:51:42,952
Yes!

621
00:53:05,992 --> 00:53:07,232
Alright, it's alright.

622
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:15,952
Don't be afraid.

623
00:53:17,471 --> 00:53:18,911
You're safe.

624
00:53:18,952 --> 00:53:20,591
It's over.

625
00:53:41,992 --> 00:53:44,912
May God give you blessings.

626
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:50,432
May God repay your kindness
in abundance.

627
00:53:52,472 --> 00:53:53,792
Amen.

628
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,991
Amen.

629
00:53:56,432 --> 00:53:58,112
Amen.

630
00:53:58,391 --> 00:54:00,071
Amen.

631
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:08,872
Amen we say, oh Lord, as we open
our hands to your holy domain...

632
00:54:09,272 --> 00:54:13,511
...let us not be without your grace,
let our hearts know contentedness.

633
00:54:13,552 --> 00:54:14,672
Amen.

634
00:54:14,711 --> 00:54:18,191
We believe there is no limit
to you mercy.

635
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:21,391
Your charity and will is infinite.

636
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:23,992
- Bless us with those, oh Lord.
- Amen.

637
00:54:24,352 --> 00:54:28,712
You adore the good, those who repent.

638
00:54:28,952 --> 00:54:32,552
Let us be able to reach you
as we ourselves repent, Lord.

639
00:54:32,591 --> 00:54:33,472
Amen.

640
00:54:33,512 --> 00:54:36,712
Oh master of all realms, oh
munificent one.

641
00:54:36,752 --> 00:54:39,352
Lighten the unbearable loads on
our souls...

642
00:54:39,392 --> 00:54:41,831
...do not let us be helpless, Lord.

643
00:54:41,872 --> 00:54:43,431
Amen.

644
00:54:43,432 --> 00:54:48,071
As we stand here today, in the funeral
rites of our beautiful Mine, bless her.

645
00:54:48,112 --> 00:54:52,592
Give us, her friends, her brother
Mete, her father Veysel...

646
00:54:52,991 --> 00:54:56,672
...and mother Ayşe strength
to bear the pain, oh Lord.

647
00:54:56,711 --> 00:55:03,472
Defend our homeland, our people, our
flag, our sacred values oh God.

648
00:55:03,712 --> 00:55:04,912
- Amen!
- El Fatiha.

649
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:19,631
My condolences, Veysel.

650
00:55:25,391 --> 00:55:26,552
Do you need anything at all?

651
00:55:27,311 --> 00:55:28,952
A leave perhaps?

652
00:55:30,032 --> 00:55:32,392
I thought I knew death, sir.

653
00:55:33,032 --> 00:55:36,272
Back in 94, General Osman and we
used to fly over dead bodies...

654
00:55:36,311 --> 00:55:39,032
...in UH helicopters...

655
00:55:40,112 --> 00:55:43,551
...we used to find out who died
where, with our noses.

656
00:55:43,552 --> 00:55:46,832
Back then America would refuse
giving night vision to our birds.

657
00:55:46,871 --> 00:55:49,511
We used to find our martyrs with nose.

658
00:55:50,111 --> 00:55:52,432
I thought I knew death.

659
00:55:52,472 --> 00:55:54,152
Now I know I didn't.

660
00:55:55,792 --> 00:55:57,592
Turns out death...

661
00:55:57,992 --> 00:56:00,151
...is waiting for my wife at the
door of the funeral home...

662
00:56:00,152 --> 00:56:02,512
...as she washes my girl's dead body.

663
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,592
I waited.

664
00:56:05,552 --> 00:56:06,671
I cried.

665
00:56:07,232 --> 00:56:09,352
I cried for dresses she'd never wear.

666
00:56:10,511 --> 00:56:13,072
I cried for fights we'd never have.

667
00:56:15,551 --> 00:56:18,112
I cried for a life unlived.

668
00:56:20,231 --> 00:56:22,912
If only she could love a man,
get married...

669
00:56:25,192 --> 00:56:26,992
...have children.

670
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:31,472
When I woke up from the daydream, I had
punched the mortuary wall 20 times.

671
00:56:32,471 --> 00:56:35,312
Blood, tears and water were everywhere.

672
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:37,232
The undertaker was bandaging my hand.

673
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:39,352
Three broken bones.

674
00:56:40,472 --> 00:56:42,152
No need for a leave.

675
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:43,991
Just have them send painkillers.

676
00:56:58,631 --> 00:57:00,712
We've eaten a third of our ammo.

677
00:57:05,471 --> 00:57:08,032
We need to reach the LZ fast, sir.

678
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,872
We are surrounded. Tracks are
everywhere. Already engaged too.

679
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:14,710
We're pushing our luck.

680
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:17,751
Do you know what they first teach you
when you get Search and Rescue command?

681
00:57:17,912 --> 00:57:19,271
Lying.

682
00:57:20,392 --> 00:57:21,872
That's not what they literally say.

683
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:24,112
But it's the essence of it.

684
00:57:25,352 --> 00:57:28,072
If morale is low nothing else matters.

685
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:31,352
You can't just tell the naked truth
to your men on days of casualties.

686
00:57:31,552 --> 00:57:33,352
You have to build a lie.

687
00:57:33,392 --> 00:57:35,312
Then you need to believe it yourself.

688
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:36,911
What kind of a lie?

689
00:57:39,472 --> 00:57:40,832
A beautiful one.

690
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:45,352
That they'll be remembered after death.

691
00:57:50,672 --> 00:57:52,272
How many men have died under my command?

692
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,231
I don't know.

693
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:57,272
23.

694
00:57:58,631 --> 00:58:01,792
I always console myself that I would
always remember those 23 men.

695
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:05,392
But each passing day I forget
their faces a little more.

696
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:36,232
Peshmerga.

697
00:58:36,272 --> 00:58:38,152
Pesheng.

698
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:40,712
**Kurdish**
How's your Turkish?

699
00:58:41,632 --> 00:58:44,111
**Kurdish**
Better than your Kurmanji.

700
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,392
You're in bad shape.

701
00:59:03,952 --> 00:59:05,831
I will give you morphine.

702
00:59:07,271 --> 00:59:08,591
What's your name?

703
00:59:09,152 --> 00:59:10,672
Çiya.

704
00:59:21,112 --> 00:59:23,111
We aren't PKK, Turk.

705
00:59:24,032 --> 00:59:25,832
We are Zerawani.

706
00:59:26,272 --> 00:59:28,112
Tell me Çiya, what happened?

707
00:59:28,151 --> 00:59:30,632
They sent us from íeqlawe.

708
00:59:31,552 --> 00:59:33,832
Then DAESH invasion began.

709
00:59:34,192 --> 00:59:35,912
We couldn't slow them.

710
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:37,832
How many were you?

711
00:59:38,351 --> 00:59:39,592
How many men were you Çiya?

712
00:59:40,672 --> 00:59:42,112
80.

713
00:59:45,311 --> 00:59:46,631
Now, just 1.

714
00:59:48,472 --> 00:59:50,072
Commander?

715
00:59:50,432 --> 00:59:52,312
Those boys were entrusted to me.

716
00:59:52,912 --> 00:59:54,272
Me.

717
00:59:55,031 --> 00:59:56,831
Now they're food for this cursed
mountain.

718
01:00:05,672 --> 01:00:07,672
Don't waste them on me.

719
01:00:08,152 --> 01:00:10,151
You will need them yourself.

720
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,831
But don't leave me here.

721
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:20,591
Don't abandon me.

722
01:00:21,071 --> 01:00:22,192
Do it.

723
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,791
Fire it on my heart.

724
01:00:25,391 --> 01:00:26,711
End it.

725
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:27,911
Enough.

726
01:00:28,912 --> 01:00:30,472
In God's name, enough.

727
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:34,112
Fire it, end it.

728
01:00:35,072 --> 01:00:36,191
Enough.

729
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:38,912
My soldiers wait for me, commander.

730
01:00:39,191 --> 01:00:40,792
They await me.

731
01:01:08,711 --> 01:01:09,872
Right now you are marble.

732
01:01:09,911 --> 01:01:13,072
Before your first mission we
will chisel your for 5 years.

733
01:01:13,552 --> 01:01:17,912
History, geography, medicine, chemistry,
guerilla warfare, psychology...

734
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:20,512
...and languages will be your
curriculum.

735
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:24,352
You will either pass a difficult
education or again, be eliminated.

736
01:01:25,072 --> 01:01:26,351
You're screwed, Bekir.

737
01:01:27,032 --> 01:01:29,032
Because you are the last castle.

738
01:01:29,951 --> 01:01:32,632
Men with knowledge as well as bravery...

739
01:01:32,672 --> 01:01:34,312
...those who do not bow to emotion...

740
01:01:34,352 --> 01:01:36,671
...first to go in, last to come out.

741
01:01:37,472 --> 01:01:39,992
You will save lives more
than you will take them.

742
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,712
This will be a hard life.

743
01:01:43,472 --> 01:01:45,352
Maybe a short one.

744
01:01:46,192 --> 01:01:48,632
Your families will share you with us.

745
01:01:49,232 --> 01:01:51,311
They will be happy with the crumbs.

746
01:01:51,911 --> 01:01:55,912
You'll miss many graduations,
anniversaries and weddings.

747
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:58,552
On your child's birthday...

748
01:01:58,592 --> 01:02:00,791
...bullets will rain atop some mountain.

749
01:02:02,792 --> 01:02:04,552
Still, it will be worth every second.

750
01:02:04,592 --> 01:02:08,192
This love, is such a love
that even if it consumes you...

751
01:02:08,672 --> 01:02:10,312
...kills you...

752
01:02:11,192 --> 01:02:12,632
...you will never let go.

753
01:02:13,232 --> 01:02:14,632
Welcome amongst us, brothers.

754
01:02:51,911 --> 01:02:53,672
Sir, Çardakl1 has visual.

755
01:02:55,672 --> 01:02:57,272
It looks so green.

756
01:02:57,311 --> 01:02:59,591
I guess Sinjar's only stream
flows there.

757
01:03:00,112 --> 01:03:02,351
Five minutes rest, then we move on.

758
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:05,351
Copy that.

759
01:03:06,352 --> 01:03:07,871
Are you Turuk?

760
01:03:08,831 --> 01:03:09,671
Excuse me?

761
01:03:09,712 --> 01:03:10,592
Turuk?

762
01:03:11,231 --> 01:03:12,791
Yes, we are Turks.

763
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:15,231
I'm also Turuk.
Çardakl1 is also kin.

764
01:03:15,232 --> 01:03:16,832
They are all Turuk.

765
01:03:17,152 --> 01:03:19,672
Çardakl1 is a Turkmen village.

766
01:03:19,912 --> 01:03:21,431
We are Turuk alright.

767
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:34,792
Wafer?

768
01:03:36,632 --> 01:03:38,231
Not this time.

769
01:03:39,952 --> 01:03:40,672
Looks clean.

770
01:03:41,591 --> 01:03:44,351
Just some civilians.
Around 30 to 40.

771
01:03:44,831 --> 01:03:46,552
Where's the LZ?

772
01:03:46,751 --> 01:03:48,352
Ahead, 100 meters lower altitude.

773
01:03:48,392 --> 01:03:51,112
We need to call the T-70s sir.
They'll just about make it.

774
01:03:53,192 --> 01:03:55,432
I can see Turkey from here.

775
01:04:03,232 --> 01:04:04,672
What's your name?

776
01:04:04,912 --> 01:04:05,951
Enegül.

777
01:04:06,191 --> 01:04:07,552
Enegül.

778
01:04:07,792 --> 01:04:10,391
I'm Bekir, Enegül.
That is Oguz.

779
01:04:12,272 --> 01:04:14,111
I tried talking, she doesn't respond.

780
01:04:20,992 --> 01:04:23,032
They carved nasheeds on her back
with a knife.

781
01:04:23,872 --> 01:04:25,871
Sons of whores.

782
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:29,431
Then again, that only insults
the whores.

783
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:32,192
These are the realities you
still ignore.

784
01:04:32,351 --> 01:04:35,072
This time, those who suffer
aren't arabs or kurds either...

785
01:04:35,111 --> 01:04:36,592
...they are Iraqi Turks.

786
01:04:39,152 --> 01:04:41,032
At least they will live.

787
01:04:41,072 --> 01:04:44,552
Here, in this barbarity...
How does one live?

788
01:04:48,832 --> 01:04:52,552
100 men, against 1000. How do they live?

789
01:04:52,912 --> 01:04:55,150
This has no simple answer, gentlemen.

790
01:04:55,151 --> 01:04:57,431
Is there a historical precedent?
Yes.

791
01:04:57,472 --> 01:05:00,472
There are the Carthaginians.
Under Hannibal's command.

792
01:05:00,512 --> 01:05:02,551
He did something similar at Cannae.

793
01:05:02,552 --> 01:05:05,032
Naturally, the truth is

794
01:05:05,312 --> 01:05:09,632
we need to examine the english theorist
B.H. Liddell Hart and his concepts.

795
01:05:10,312 --> 01:05:13,991
During this battle, Romans were,
as always, too confident...

796
01:05:14,032 --> 01:05:14,912
...86 thousand men...

797
01:05:14,951 --> 01:05:16,271
You know what I miss?

798
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:20,431
...in three main columns, they
attacked with the middle strongest.

799
01:05:20,432 --> 01:05:21,791
Fist-fighting you.

800
01:05:21,832 --> 01:05:26,192
I wish I could just tussle once
more before you became my superior.

801
01:05:27,152 --> 01:05:29,110
You're seriously crazy, man.

802
01:05:29,111 --> 01:05:31,192
Bekir, Oguz, what's going on?

803
01:05:31,991 --> 01:05:35,672
Sir, our friend Bekir here
wants to fight me one last time.

804
01:05:35,711 --> 01:05:36,832
You fucking rat.

805
01:05:36,872 --> 01:05:40,072
According to Hart's doctrine
How do 10 men fight against 100?

806
01:05:40,112 --> 01:05:43,151
Answer it properly, go out during
the break, and beat each other up.

807
01:05:43,391 --> 01:05:44,392
I allow it.

808
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:49,271
Sir, 1000 people will always crush 100.
Reality of numbers.

809
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:53,192
The only way to win, according
to Hart is to fight indirectly.

810
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:54,991
How, explain that too.

811
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:59,672
To focus on the vulnerable joints using
any trick and advantage possible.

812
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:02,432
Oh yes.

813
01:06:03,032 --> 01:06:05,992
Our final fight.
The closing of an era.

814
01:06:06,032 --> 01:06:07,592
A clean punch to the face wins.

815
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:09,632
What's the matter bro?
Scared of two?

816
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:11,312
May he who fears you, become you.

817
01:06:11,552 --> 01:06:14,072
Come on shithead.
Come.

818
01:06:17,351 --> 01:06:19,712
You're learning something. Come.

819
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:32,552
You alright?

820
01:06:33,431 --> 01:06:34,832
You alright man?

821
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:36,992
Dude... you indirect warfare shit.

822
01:06:37,192 --> 01:06:39,112
Who ever hits the nose?

823
01:06:39,152 --> 01:06:41,272
Sorry man, not intentional.
I'm not Emin Boztepe.

824
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:44,711
Stop, don't stand.
Look up.

825
01:06:48,071 --> 01:06:49,751
I fell in love with a girl.

826
01:06:50,912 --> 01:06:52,391
We met the other day.

827
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,472
I think she likes me.

828
01:06:56,432 --> 01:06:58,352
100 billion galaxies.

829
01:06:58,552 --> 01:07:01,712
In each one, 100 billion stars,
countless planets.

830
01:07:02,312 --> 01:07:04,151
And a girl likes Bekir.

831
01:07:04,432 --> 01:07:06,232
She might be the woman I marry.

832
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,592
What the shit?

833
01:07:13,631 --> 01:07:14,872
You're serious.

834
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:19,232
Way to go Bekir. Live that life.

835
01:07:20,951 --> 01:07:22,751
How does one live a life?

836
01:07:34,511 --> 01:07:36,832
Where the cloud casts a shadow,
that's the LZ, sir.

837
01:07:37,712 --> 01:07:39,431
Looks like my hometown.

838
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:42,191
Do they have 50 cal echoes in
Bilecik too?

839
01:07:42,232 --> 01:07:44,392
You don't know our girls.

840
01:09:04,832 --> 01:09:06,472
Greetings.

841
01:09:06,512 --> 01:09:07,911
Well met.

842
01:09:07,912 --> 01:09:09,232
Are you Turkish soldiers?

843
01:09:10,232 --> 01:09:12,752
- We are.
- Prepare qelyanalti, move it.

844
01:09:13,072 --> 01:09:14,831
Qelyanalti?

845
01:09:15,392 --> 01:09:16,552
What is that?

846
01:09:16,592 --> 01:09:18,472
Afternoon breakfast.

847
01:09:19,352 --> 01:09:20,792
Would be rude to refuse, right?

848
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:24,311
I agree.

849
01:09:25,352 --> 01:09:27,550
Only fighter left in our village
is Boran.

850
01:09:27,551 --> 01:09:30,071
Go speak to him.

851
01:09:33,191 --> 01:09:35,591
- Welcome.
- Well met.

852
01:09:35,632 --> 01:09:37,112
How many in this village, Boran?

853
01:09:37,751 --> 01:09:39,832
25 adults, 15 children.

854
01:09:40,072 --> 01:09:42,431
I'm the only one who
can carry a weapon, sir.

855
01:09:42,472 --> 01:09:44,431
Gentlemen, rest without
bothering anyone..

856
01:09:44,432 --> 01:09:46,511
Last stop before returning home.

857
01:09:46,832 --> 01:09:49,192
You can rest in my home. Come.

858
01:09:49,391 --> 01:09:51,272
Don't stay out. Come in.

859
01:10:08,471 --> 01:10:10,352
Thanks, we are being a burden.

860
01:10:10,391 --> 01:10:11,792
Don't you mention it commander.

861
01:10:11,831 --> 01:10:14,512
The children here dream
of becoming Turkish soldiers.

862
01:10:14,552 --> 01:10:16,271
We grow up with your tales.

863
01:10:17,192 --> 01:10:20,111
- Your Turkish is great, Boran.
- I went to school in Gaziantep.

864
01:10:20,872 --> 01:10:22,952
Before the war my father
used to import from Turkey.

865
01:10:22,991 --> 01:10:25,271
The cobblestones on the village
square were his goods.

866
01:10:25,312 --> 01:10:27,671
After he died we never got to finish.

867
01:10:28,192 --> 01:10:30,791
If you don't mind me asking,
what happened your leg?

868
01:10:31,751 --> 01:10:34,352
When those animals attacked
Talafar three years ago...

869
01:10:34,391 --> 01:10:36,431
...we went to defend as a family.

870
01:10:37,312 --> 01:10:38,432
I got one on the knee.

871
01:10:39,632 --> 01:10:43,871
Commander, these lands were
the most fertile around Sinjar.

872
01:10:44,072 --> 01:10:46,672
Wheat and fruit used to grow here.

873
01:10:47,072 --> 01:10:49,192
After the war all were ruined.

874
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:51,992
Ottomans used to called
this place Turkmenreach.

875
01:10:52,031 --> 01:10:53,591
Nothing to reach anymore.

876
01:10:53,632 --> 01:10:58,232
We're surrounded. Like an island
on a sea of arabs and kurds.

877
01:10:59,231 --> 01:11:01,271
Storm Bringer...

878
01:11:02,752 --> 01:11:05,631
662 Tamu Cizre.
This is Storm Bringer.

879
01:11:05,632 --> 01:11:08,111
Our new call sign, 923 Mountain.

880
01:11:08,992 --> 01:11:12,232
Mountain, your signal is weak,
but copy that.

881
01:11:12,712 --> 01:11:15,512
662 Tamu Cizre.
Mountain standing by.

882
01:11:17,072 --> 01:11:19,352
Mountain, this is Wolf. Veysel?

883
01:11:23,152 --> 01:11:24,431
I am here, sir.

884
01:11:25,232 --> 01:11:28,390
Terrorists have crushed both the Iraqi
army and the kurds, the region is falling.

885
01:11:28,391 --> 01:11:31,952
Their main battalion, 100 strong are
pillaging towards the last village.

886
01:11:32,231 --> 01:11:34,191
Are you ready for extraction?

887
01:11:34,192 --> 01:11:35,792
Which village?

888
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,031
Çardakl1. They arrive tomorrow noon.

889
01:11:39,032 --> 01:11:42,272
Confirm the LZ, and get out
before dawn. Over.

890
01:11:50,392 --> 01:11:53,111
I know commander.
It's alright.

891
01:11:53,152 --> 01:11:56,152
Let us see you off unharmed,
that alone is enough.

892
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:04,751
- Lt. Colonel, this is a Shia village.
- I know.

893
01:12:04,792 --> 01:12:07,151
Will you listen to me one minute?

894
01:12:07,352 --> 01:12:08,711
Veysel!

895
01:12:13,511 --> 01:12:15,472
They will kill everyone here.

896
01:12:15,952 --> 01:12:17,471
Our mission is not to defend them.

897
01:12:18,911 --> 01:12:21,672
- The mission isn't the issue here.
- The mission is the entire issue!

898
01:12:21,992 --> 01:12:24,592
My own feelings and desires are
of no consequence.

899
01:12:26,152 --> 01:12:28,552
The mission is the only issue.

900
01:12:31,631 --> 01:12:34,472
In your world, your sense of
responsibility means idealism.

901
01:12:34,511 --> 01:12:36,592
An altruistic dream of helping everyone.

902
01:12:36,992 --> 01:12:40,192
In mine it's to keep my men
alive, whom I love like family...

903
01:12:40,232 --> 01:12:42,232
...these brave, few men.

904
01:12:43,232 --> 01:12:44,912
The entire issue is the mission.

905
01:12:46,192 --> 01:12:47,672
No, sir.

906
01:12:47,872 --> 01:12:50,912
The issue here, is
what bravery really is.

907
01:12:51,551 --> 01:12:54,832
Bravery is not killing the enemy, or
defending borders drawn on a map.

908
01:12:55,391 --> 01:12:57,791
There is only one righteous
reason for bravery in war.

909
01:12:57,832 --> 01:12:59,432
And that is defending the innocent.

910
01:13:01,672 --> 01:13:04,271
That war is coming commander.
That war is coming here.

911
01:13:04,952 --> 01:13:06,511
Does this village deserve it?

912
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:08,792
Do these people deserve that fate?

913
01:13:10,631 --> 01:13:12,112
Say something.

914
01:13:18,872 --> 01:13:20,831
Enegül come here.

915
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:24,191
Come, dear.

916
01:13:24,671 --> 01:13:26,392
Tell her.

917
01:13:27,472 --> 01:13:29,872
Tell her so she knows.
Say "We're leaving".

918
01:13:29,912 --> 01:13:32,311
Say "There won't be a single living
person here, tomorrow afternoon”.

919
01:13:32,312 --> 01:13:34,271
What will they do to this girl, sir?

920
01:13:34,312 --> 01:13:35,752
Tell her, so she knows.

921
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:37,672
Tell her!

922
01:13:40,712 --> 01:13:45,232
If courage is leaving this girl, and
all the villagers to their fate...

923
01:13:46,432 --> 01:13:48,352
...I would rather be a coward.

924
01:13:49,751 --> 01:13:52,072
You can keep on being brave.

925
01:14:14,072 --> 01:14:16,312
“Sir”? What are you doing here?

926
01:14:17,752 --> 01:14:19,832
It was crowded, I wanted some fresh air.

927
01:14:19,871 --> 01:14:22,111
What are you yourself doing out?
You're a married man now.

928
01:14:22,112 --> 01:14:24,152
I was looking for you, dumbass.

929
01:14:24,191 --> 01:14:27,551
C'mon, it was my mother's dying
wish, We have to make my dad dance.

930
01:14:27,592 --> 01:14:28,472
C'mon.

931
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,272
Where is Ece, by the way?

932
01:14:33,752 --> 01:14:35,231
We broke up.

933
01:14:35,591 --> 01:14:36,911
Why man?

934
01:14:37,151 --> 01:14:38,392
No idea.

935
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:41,152
I guess 2 years with me,
is like 20 years with you.

936
01:14:44,392 --> 01:14:46,192
You know, I don't have many friends.

937
01:14:47,912 --> 01:14:49,832
Actually I only have one.

938
01:14:51,392 --> 01:14:54,632
Thank God though, I get to
observe this one idiot.

939
01:14:54,832 --> 01:14:58,472
This guy thinks too much, Oguz.
More he thinks, more he fucks up.

940
01:15:00,071 --> 01:15:02,231
He thinks he's alone.

941
01:15:03,112 --> 01:15:05,231
But he ain't.

942
01:15:06,712 --> 01:15:08,672
He needs to know this.

943
01:15:08,992 --> 01:15:11,111
- This friend of yours?
- Exactly.

944
01:15:11,951 --> 01:15:13,511
I'll tell him, if I see him.

945
01:15:14,831 --> 01:15:17,872
Bro, they told me a ring might
cause problems during a jump.

946
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:20,432
We came up with this solution.

947
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:22,232
Respect, man.

948
01:15:22,271 --> 01:15:24,191
3 years ago you said you'd get married.

949
01:15:24,232 --> 01:15:26,072
Here we are and you're getting married.

950
01:15:26,512 --> 01:15:28,511
This is how we live, I guess.

951
01:15:28,552 --> 01:15:30,472
Learn by falling and getting back up.

952
01:15:30,512 --> 01:15:32,151
I wish you the same.

953
01:15:32,152 --> 01:15:33,752
Me?

954
01:15:34,712 --> 01:15:37,592
Get up come on. I need to watch
you ruin this dance, move it.

955
01:15:37,752 --> 01:15:39,951
Me? Not a chance.

956
01:15:39,992 --> 01:15:42,591
I'll order you and you'll fucking do it.

957
01:15:42,632 --> 01:15:43,712
C'mon.

958
01:15:44,112 --> 01:15:45,351
You know what?

959
01:15:45,392 --> 01:15:47,991
I beat you up so good that day,
I kinda miss it now.

960
01:15:48,032 --> 01:15:50,871
How quickly you forgot 3 years ago.
I popped your nose open.

961
01:15:50,912 --> 01:15:52,431
- Oh really?
- Yes really, move.

962
01:15:52,472 --> 01:15:55,112
- Let's see how you do in Ankara.
- Game on.

963
01:16:34,831 --> 01:16:37,152
Is Turkey pretty sister Ceyda?

964
01:16:39,672 --> 01:16:41,712
Dawn will break Enegül, go to sleep.

965
01:16:41,911 --> 01:16:43,752
Sister Nabat tell us. You went there.

966
01:16:46,111 --> 01:16:49,272
The soil is not orange like it is here.

967
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:51,151
Ashen and green.

968
01:16:52,591 --> 01:16:54,672
There is cold and warm.

969
01:16:55,272 --> 01:16:58,992
Dew falls on flowers each
morning, without harming them.

970
01:17:00,312 --> 01:17:02,752
Their mountains have waterfalls.

971
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,991
Their peaks aren't bald like ours.

972
01:17:05,992 --> 01:17:07,672
They have it all.

973
01:17:08,112 --> 01:17:10,672
All the good, all the bad.

974
01:17:11,632 --> 01:17:15,832
When you walk in autumn,
your feet may be wet or dry.

975
01:17:17,752 --> 01:17:20,232
A bird may shit or land on you.

976
01:17:21,232 --> 01:17:22,831
Are their birds pretty?

977
01:17:23,152 --> 01:17:24,871
They are.

978
01:17:25,231 --> 01:17:27,672
Storks fly all around.

979
01:17:28,072 --> 01:17:31,231
Falcons hunt lesser birds on hills.

980
01:17:32,071 --> 01:17:35,512
Skylarks nest on city roofs.

981
01:17:36,712 --> 01:17:38,431
Their cities are like fields.

982
01:17:38,632 --> 01:17:42,352
Antep, 0stanbul, Ankara.

983
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:44,512
Buildings until the horizon.

984
01:17:45,031 --> 01:17:46,591
Will we go one day?

985
01:17:50,272 --> 01:17:51,832
We will, Enegül.

986
01:17:52,111 --> 01:17:53,272
We will.

987
01:17:53,311 --> 01:17:54,672
Go to sleep.

988
01:18:05,032 --> 01:18:06,312
Sir.

989
01:18:06,511 --> 01:18:08,951
Bekir and Arif are on sentry.
Others are resting.

990
01:18:08,952 --> 01:18:11,352
Cizre will send the T-70 at dawn.

991
01:18:13,831 --> 01:18:15,991
You will be a good officer, Oguz.

992
01:18:16,471 --> 01:18:17,712
Despite me.

993
01:18:20,791 --> 01:18:23,272
20 years from now...

994
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:27,991
...hundreds of men will look to
your words for everything...

995
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:32,070
Some of them will be troopers,
natural born soldiers.

996
01:18:32,071 --> 01:18:33,871
Others young and foolish.

997
01:18:34,792 --> 01:18:38,032
But all of them will follow your
example, Oguz.

998
01:18:39,112 --> 01:18:41,992
If you show wisdom and awareness,
they will be wise and aware...

999
01:18:42,631 --> 01:18:45,751
...if you show loyalty and bravery
they'll grow to be loyal and brave.

1000
01:18:46,792 --> 01:18:47,712
But above all...

1001
01:18:47,752 --> 01:18:51,271
...those under your command will
live and die...

1002
01:18:51,312 --> 01:18:53,032
...by your decisions, Oguz.

1003
01:18:54,192 --> 01:18:56,191
And then one day...

1004
01:18:57,391 --> 01:19:01,031
...you'll have to decide between
what's right and the mission.

1005
01:19:01,032 --> 01:19:03,712
The right thing is the mission, sir..

1006
01:19:03,751 --> 01:19:05,872
What's right, is the right thing, Oguz.

1007
01:19:06,432 --> 01:19:08,592
I've ignored many right things
for missions.

1008
01:19:16,432 --> 01:19:19,312
Back when we were your age
we served southeast with Yaşar.

1009
01:19:20,032 --> 01:19:22,431
We were both born and raised
in Eskişehir.

1010
01:19:22,432 --> 01:19:25,992
But if you asked us the city we
were from, we'd say í1rnak.

1011
01:19:27,232 --> 01:19:29,071
Not because of time stayed there...

1012
01:19:31,152 --> 01:19:33,391
...but because of our souls we spent.

1013
01:19:33,871 --> 01:19:36,631
If you only knew the friends we
had to lose for missions.

1014
01:19:38,191 --> 01:19:40,512
Seven years ago, Captain Yaşar...

1015
01:19:40,552 --> 01:19:43,231
...caught Bekir and I cussing at
each other once again.

1016
01:19:43,272 --> 01:19:45,312
He'd warned us 20 times by then.

1017
01:19:45,352 --> 01:19:48,232
Seeing that we were hopeless he
assigned a latrine to each...

1018
01:19:48,271 --> 01:19:50,671
...and forbid us using any other.

1019
01:19:50,872 --> 01:19:56,032
“You will clean your respective
shits every single day” he said.

1020
01:19:56,431 --> 01:19:58,752
He had this smile on his face.

1021
01:20:00,991 --> 01:20:05,311
He was smiling because they'd given
us the same punishment back in 88.

1022
01:20:06,192 --> 01:20:08,112
We became so polite within a week.

1023
01:20:14,112 --> 01:20:15,792
He was my Bekir, Oguz.

1024
01:20:17,272 --> 01:20:18,792
My best friend.

1025
01:20:20,512 --> 01:20:23,032
I chose the mission again
and couldn't make it in time.

1026
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:26,752
He died because of me.

1027
01:20:29,592 --> 01:20:31,432
What would you do?

1028
01:20:35,392 --> 01:20:37,351
Sir, I...

1029
01:20:37,992 --> 01:20:40,591
...my head says we need to get out.

1030
01:20:40,912 --> 01:20:43,231
This has no end and numbers never lie.

1031
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:44,472
True.

1032
01:20:44,872 --> 01:20:47,472
But my heart, sir...

1033
01:20:48,832 --> 01:20:51,271
...it's trying to fool me.

1034
01:20:51,511 --> 01:20:54,232
Says we can't abandon villagers
to murder.

1035
01:20:56,311 --> 01:20:59,392
Maybe, there's a chance that...

1036
01:21:00,432 --> 01:21:02,112
...we defend this place and live...

1037
01:21:02,752 --> 01:21:05,232
...then look back and say that
as Turkish soldiers...

1038
01:21:06,151 --> 01:21:09,151
...we did the right thing
as well as our duty.

1039
01:23:35,191 --> 01:23:36,631
Commander, what is going on?

1040
01:23:36,672 --> 01:23:38,632
All the village children have boarded.

1041
01:23:38,671 --> 01:23:41,232
Time for the unruly one.

1042
01:23:44,551 --> 01:23:46,831
- I won't go.
- You're the mission, Ceyda.

1043
01:23:47,152 --> 01:23:49,111
I'll do something, sir. I can be of use!

1044
01:23:49,152 --> 01:23:52,432
No. You returning, is not
open to discussion.

1045
01:23:53,071 --> 01:23:54,631
Just promise me one thing.

1046
01:23:55,711 --> 01:23:58,512
You will not speak of this.
You will not write it.

1047
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:00,751
It will be a secret forever.

1048
01:24:01,591 --> 01:24:03,031
Why?

1049
01:24:03,192 --> 01:24:04,471
We are nothing.

1050
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,552
Shadows. What we do must not be known.

1051
01:24:08,152 --> 01:24:09,112
Promise me.

1052
01:24:19,792 --> 01:24:21,271
I promise!

1053
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:32,472
Open it when you arrive.

1054
01:25:18,432 --> 01:25:20,632
071 Wolf, this is Mountain.

1055
01:25:20,671 --> 01:25:22,872
Mountain, this is Wolf.
Your orders were clear!

1056
01:25:22,912 --> 01:25:25,991
Why is Falcon-1 not carrying you?
What the hell are you doing Veysel?

1057
01:25:25,992 --> 01:25:27,952
Sir we've delivered Ceyda.

1058
01:25:27,991 --> 01:25:31,471
But they had to leave early
due to the coming storm.

1059
01:25:31,711 --> 01:25:33,552
What storm, Veysel?!

1060
01:25:35,472 --> 01:25:38,551
Sir, I will consult my team
one by one, just to be sure.

1061
01:25:42,312 --> 01:25:45,552
Master Sergeant Mustafa Sahin.
I concur with my commander.

1062
01:25:48,072 --> 01:25:50,872
Staff Sergeant Arif Sayar.
I agree, sir.

1063
01:25:53,032 --> 01:25:55,752
First Lieutenant Oguz.
The weather is terrible, sir.

1064
01:25:58,351 --> 01:26:01,312
Sergeant Baybars Yücel.
I concur, sir.

1065
01:26:04,752 --> 01:26:08,071
Specialist Bekir Özbey.
Likewise sir.

1066
01:26:14,431 --> 01:26:16,152
Master Sergeant Eşref Çullu.

1067
01:26:17,152 --> 01:26:19,152
A storm is coming, sir.

1068
01:26:25,392 --> 01:26:27,472
Sir, the entire team concurs.

1069
01:26:27,751 --> 01:26:29,992
We'll try again tomorrow morning.

1070
01:26:30,552 --> 01:26:31,992
Veysel.

1071
01:26:32,431 --> 01:26:34,272
Your orders, sir.

1072
01:26:36,352 --> 01:26:38,831
Weather deterioration noted.
We are standing by.

1073
01:26:38,832 --> 01:26:41,032
May God help you all. Over.

1074
01:26:48,432 --> 01:26:51,031
In 1950 we used to say 'Iraqi Turks'.

1075
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:53,632
Then suddenly we were forced
to call them Turkmen.

1076
01:26:54,672 --> 01:26:58,951
For us, land to be defended,
is land where our people live.

1077
01:26:59,392 --> 01:27:01,830
These villagers are our people.

1078
01:27:01,831 --> 01:27:04,192
- Eşref, you have it with you?
- Always, sir.

1079
01:27:04,231 --> 01:27:05,871
- Baybars?
- Your orders, sir.

1080
01:27:05,872 --> 01:27:08,272
Go, raise it on the village peak.

1081
01:27:08,911 --> 01:27:10,792
Today, this place is homeland.

1082
01:27:35,832 --> 01:27:36,992
This is not an American film.

1083
01:27:37,032 --> 01:27:39,712
Last minute air support won't
clear out those hundred men.

1084
01:27:40,432 --> 01:27:41,311
Mustafa.

1085
01:27:41,352 --> 01:27:43,312
Everything is here sir.

1086
01:27:43,351 --> 01:27:45,511
4 mags per rifle.

1087
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:48,192
I got two rockets, for emergencies.

1088
01:27:48,232 --> 01:27:50,791
I can rig the C4's for remote
detonation is I crack a comm.

1089
01:27:51,832 --> 01:27:53,911
The village also has some gasoline.

1090
01:27:54,792 --> 01:27:56,752
If I break the DskH rounds...

1091
01:27:57,352 --> 01:27:59,752
...fill the shells and powder
within gas jugs as shrapnel...

1092
01:28:00,952 --> 01:28:04,071
Good. Divide all the benzene and
paraffin equally.

1093
01:28:04,072 --> 01:28:05,472
Oguz, explain.

1094
01:28:05,512 --> 01:28:07,231
There are two routes into the village.

1095
01:28:07,512 --> 01:28:09,552
The mosque path and the school path.

1096
01:28:10,152 --> 01:28:13,752
The mosque path is wider
but we got a choke point here.

1097
01:28:13,792 --> 01:28:17,112
This is the joint. Vehicles
must cross here.

1098
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:18,832
We can use it.

1099
01:28:18,871 --> 01:28:20,872
I can rig a killbox with the C4's.

1100
01:28:21,072 --> 01:28:22,831
Two on each side of the road.

1101
01:28:22,872 --> 01:28:25,311
- Will take care of every truck.
- Then what?

1102
01:28:25,312 --> 01:28:27,072
No IED will kill 100 men.

1103
01:28:27,271 --> 01:28:30,432
We're going to need man to man
engagement if they slip in.

1104
01:28:31,392 --> 01:28:33,832
I just wish we had a guardian angel.

1105
01:28:34,992 --> 01:28:37,032
We send you up.

1106
01:28:40,872 --> 01:28:43,032
Always wanted to be a muezzin as a kid.

1107
01:28:43,072 --> 01:28:46,432
- Why didn't you do it?
- They said I had a horrible voice.

1108
01:28:47,392 --> 01:28:49,512
If they reach iron sights I'm fucked.

1109
01:28:49,552 --> 01:28:51,712
Need someone to keep the mosque clean.

1110
01:28:53,952 --> 01:28:56,352
- Boran can you do this?
- Say die, and I'll die, sir.

1111
01:28:56,992 --> 01:28:58,351
How do we position sir?

1112
01:28:58,392 --> 01:29:00,871
You, Mustafa, Oguz and I, we're
the vanguard.

1113
01:29:00,912 --> 01:29:03,672
After we collect our blood toll
at the bottleneck...

1114
01:29:03,712 --> 01:29:06,871
...we come here, to point green,
to you and Mustafa.

1115
01:29:17,752 --> 01:29:19,951
'Baybars Cocktail'.

1116
01:29:22,152 --> 01:29:23,992
Yücel Cocktail.

1117
01:29:24,031 --> 01:29:25,831
Molotov was his surname.

1118
01:29:27,192 --> 01:29:29,512
They must never know our real numbers.

1119
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:33,031
We need someone to run around,
carrying ammo to displacers.

1120
01:29:33,592 --> 01:29:34,951
Veysel Commander?

1121
01:29:35,911 --> 01:29:37,711
Let me help.

1122
01:29:43,512 --> 01:29:46,072
The battle makes the warrior.

1123
01:29:48,912 --> 01:29:50,791
Let me help.

1124
01:29:54,712 --> 01:29:57,472
No mercy for those who try
to take this village.

1125
01:29:59,712 --> 01:30:02,472
You will make every invader crawl.

1126
01:30:02,832 --> 01:30:06,511
They will curse the day they
first took a step here.

1127
01:30:06,952 --> 01:30:10,351
They won't fear death, they'll fear us.

1128
01:30:10,512 --> 01:30:13,752
Village flank is the only weak
point. Where the school faces.

1129
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:15,712
How many rounds do you have left?

1130
01:30:15,751 --> 01:30:16,792
300.

1131
01:30:17,152 --> 01:30:18,672
I'll be stingy.

1132
01:30:18,952 --> 01:30:21,112
- What is this place?
- Coalhouse.

1133
01:30:21,672 --> 01:30:23,431
It has a shelter under it.

1134
01:30:23,472 --> 01:30:25,432
Bring remaining civilians here.

1135
01:30:25,471 --> 01:30:27,352
This place falls, the village falls.

1136
01:30:27,792 --> 01:30:29,352
The Last Castle.

1137
01:30:30,031 --> 01:30:32,191
Sir. This is not the Last Castle.

1138
01:30:33,031 --> 01:30:34,432
We are.

1139
01:30:57,552 --> 01:31:00,312
No matter what keep the door closed.

1140
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:07,591
Sir, please. Ceyda is gone.
If you would only allow it.

1141
01:31:07,632 --> 01:31:09,432
Keep the vox on so I can hear.

1142
01:31:09,792 --> 01:31:11,512
Just the initials.

1143
01:31:12,672 --> 01:31:14,512
And you can't ask me.

1144
01:31:15,232 --> 01:31:16,512
Go ahead then.

1145
01:31:17,191 --> 01:31:19,951
Well, I was just a kid
back then, 15 or 16.

1146
01:31:21,192 --> 01:31:23,032
Her initial was “E”.

1147
01:31:23,431 --> 01:31:25,072
She was 3-4 years older than I.

1148
01:31:25,351 --> 01:31:28,912
You know how you look at
something disgusting and cringe?

1149
01:31:29,191 --> 01:31:31,752
That's how she looked at me, like shit.

1150
01:31:33,712 --> 01:31:35,311
Turns out she liked me.

1151
01:31:36,432 --> 01:31:38,472
Then she invites me to drink lemonade.

1152
01:31:38,512 --> 01:31:41,152
I swear, sir, next thing I know
I open my eyes in her bedroom.

1153
01:31:42,391 --> 01:31:44,311
Somehow, it really happened.

1154
01:31:44,671 --> 01:31:46,312
For 11 seconds.

1155
01:31:49,351 --> 01:31:50,272
A.

1156
01:31:51,391 --> 01:31:52,312
From Sar1yer.

1157
01:31:52,752 --> 01:31:54,072
We had dated for a year.

1158
01:31:54,112 --> 01:31:55,831
I took her to a romantic dinner.

1159
01:31:55,872 --> 01:31:57,792
She was pretty scared.

1160
01:31:57,991 --> 01:32:01,552
As if I'd dump her and she'd have
no value after we made love.

1161
01:32:02,232 --> 01:32:03,511
But that's not what happened.

1162
01:32:04,792 --> 01:32:06,312
We dated for another 1.5 years.

1163
01:32:06,672 --> 01:32:08,272
Then she dumped me.

1164
01:32:08,472 --> 01:32:11,032
Mine was also a girlfriend. Z.

1165
01:32:12,072 --> 01:32:12,792
And?

1166
01:32:13,831 --> 01:32:15,232
That's all you need to know rookie.

1167
01:32:15,391 --> 01:32:16,312
Sheesh.

1168
01:32:17,752 --> 01:32:20,713
It's going to be pretty hard for Sergeant
Mustafa to remember 60 years ago.

1169
01:32:22,471 --> 01:32:23,392
F.

1170
01:32:24,552 --> 01:32:26,191
She was singer.

1171
01:32:26,632 --> 01:32:27,751
A singer?!

1172
01:32:28,192 --> 01:32:29,512
In a tavern.

1173
01:32:30,631 --> 01:32:33,432
Met her on the first day of
rookie leave.

1174
01:32:33,952 --> 01:32:36,192
Seeing my haircut, she thought I
was an officer.

1175
01:32:36,391 --> 01:32:37,831
I didn't tell otherwise.

1176
01:32:38,311 --> 01:32:42,151
Then, in a couple of months
I gathered my courage...

1177
01:32:42,192 --> 01:32:44,112
...and declared my love.

1178
01:32:44,472 --> 01:32:45,552
Oh God.

1179
01:32:45,751 --> 01:32:48,991
It was the 80's. Everybody was romantic.

1180
01:32:49,032 --> 01:32:51,231
F was an incredible woman.

1181
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:53,431
She had breasts the size of my head.

1182
01:32:53,671 --> 01:32:56,512
That woman was like a film star
and a diva rolled into one.

1183
01:32:58,032 --> 01:32:59,832
I wonder where she is now.

1184
01:33:01,192 --> 01:33:02,872
I was 19.

1185
01:33:03,271 --> 01:33:05,311
Had a two year girlfriend.

1186
01:33:06,232 --> 01:33:09,552
We were into each other,
but could never be alone.

1187
01:33:10,432 --> 01:33:11,751
Couldn't convince past second base.

1188
01:33:11,752 --> 01:33:14,392
Anyways, she had this best friend.

1189
01:33:14,431 --> 01:33:16,792
That girl invited me to help
with homework.

1190
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:18,312
B.

1191
01:33:18,751 --> 01:33:20,991
She seduced me a little.

1192
01:33:20,992 --> 01:33:24,192
I was a teen so I couldn't resist.

1193
01:33:25,312 --> 01:33:27,952
Well after my girl learned,
of course she dumped my ass.

1194
01:33:27,991 --> 01:33:29,232
Wow, wow, wow.

1195
01:33:29,952 --> 01:33:31,632
You see sir...

1196
01:33:31,672 --> 01:33:33,111
...this scoundrel...

1197
01:33:33,112 --> 01:33:35,392
should have been eliminated.

1198
01:33:35,431 --> 01:33:38,671
Funny thing is, they're still besties.

1199
01:33:44,592 --> 01:33:46,231
I'm a classic guy.

1200
01:33:47,272 --> 01:33:50,671
Sebahat. My first and only love.

1201
01:33:52,231 --> 01:33:54,672
She was the beauty of Akçaabat.

1202
01:33:55,312 --> 01:33:57,792
We got hitched a day before deployment.

1203
01:33:58,192 --> 01:34:00,912
Couldn't wait since something
might happen to me.

1204
01:34:01,632 --> 01:34:04,471
Next day I was on a convoy to
Kerşan camp.

1205
01:34:04,512 --> 01:34:07,231
Suddenly an RPG hit our Unimog's
rear tire.

1206
01:34:07,272 --> 01:34:09,150
Two died that very second.

1207
01:34:09,151 --> 01:34:11,311
PKM rounds bouncing everywhere.

1208
01:34:12,192 --> 01:34:13,351
Then I realize, I'm shaking.

1209
01:34:13,392 --> 01:34:15,792
I think I'll never see Sebahat again.

1210
01:34:15,832 --> 01:34:19,552
I accept it. You know how people
feel, 'nothing will happen to me'...

1211
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,032
...this was the moment it ended.

1212
01:34:22,432 --> 01:34:26,712
A sergeant with shrapnel sticking out of
his jaw screams at us to remain calm...

1213
01:34:26,752 --> 01:34:30,112
...he puts in a cassette. Rock music
begins playing in the vehicle.

1214
01:34:30,712 --> 01:34:33,271
Outside ricochets keep rhythm..

1215
01:34:35,232 --> 01:34:37,312
Suddenly I begin enjoying it.

1216
01:34:38,431 --> 01:34:40,752
I realize I'm probably going insane.

1217
01:34:40,792 --> 01:34:42,631
You were a kid back then Eşref.

1218
01:34:42,672 --> 01:34:44,872
Frankly sir, I still got the
same feeling.

1219
01:34:45,912 --> 01:34:48,030
Only now, I never shake.

1220
01:34:48,031 --> 01:34:49,831
I'll find Sebahat even if I die.

1221
01:34:50,752 --> 01:34:53,112
- Visual!
- It's time, gentleman.

1222
01:34:57,592 --> 01:34:59,392
Arif, talk to me.

1223
01:35:00,232 --> 01:35:01,872
Battalion.

1224
01:35:01,912 --> 01:35:04,312
200 plus change. 8 tactical Hiluxes.

1225
01:35:09,072 --> 01:35:11,232
And one Abrams.

1226
01:35:30,031 --> 01:35:31,552
Abrams?

1227
01:35:32,152 --> 01:35:33,511
More good news.

1228
01:35:33,751 --> 01:35:35,551
- What's the formation?
- Two columns, sir.

1229
01:35:35,592 --> 01:35:37,672
Infantry ahead and rear.
Classic Saddam.

1230
01:35:37,711 --> 01:35:38,911
Five minutes.

1231
01:35:48,232 --> 01:35:50,392
Fear is good.
You'll run faster.

1232
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:53,191
They have a tank!

1233
01:35:54,031 --> 01:35:56,032
But we have a Bekir.

1234
01:35:58,471 --> 01:36:00,751
Eşref, do what you do best.

1235
01:36:01,552 --> 01:36:04,512
And if you get exposed earman,
know that I watch over you.

1236
01:36:07,351 --> 01:36:09,151
- Bekir?
- Ready sir.

1237
01:36:13,152 --> 01:36:14,911
Come, all of you.

1238
01:36:20,832 --> 01:36:21,751
Wear this.

1239
01:36:29,232 --> 01:36:31,591
Would this stop a bullet, sir?

1240
01:36:31,951 --> 01:36:34,752
No. But it will stop ricochets.

1241
01:36:42,912 --> 01:36:44,671
Take cover. Over there.

1242
01:36:45,472 --> 01:36:46,911
They're approaching the chokepoint.

1243
01:36:46,912 --> 01:36:50,272
Arif, shrink your profile.

1244
01:36:56,472 --> 01:36:58,351
Brave die once, cowards thousands.

1245
01:36:58,912 --> 01:37:00,912
Brave die once, cowards thousands.

1246
01:37:01,912 --> 01:37:04,231
Channel 4. When you press it.

1247
01:37:04,272 --> 01:37:05,752
One. Two.

1248
01:37:14,152 --> 01:37:15,432
Three.

1249
01:37:57,832 --> 01:37:58,711
Four.

1250
01:38:02,232 --> 01:38:03,232
Now.

1251
01:38:11,752 --> 01:38:13,512
Why yell on a mountain?

1252
01:38:13,912 --> 01:38:16,072
To defy fate.

1253
01:39:06,192 --> 01:39:07,072
Flanks!

1254
01:39:47,392 --> 01:39:48,432
Move it!

1255
01:39:52,711 --> 01:39:54,952
Baybars! We can't hold this tank!

1256
01:39:55,471 --> 01:39:56,872
Run to the chokepoint!

1257
01:40:09,072 --> 01:40:10,792
Boran, get ready!

1258
01:40:18,871 --> 01:40:20,791
Arif, they're leaking in!

1259
01:40:27,712 --> 01:40:30,432
Bekir, back! Covering fire!

1260
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:26,791
You're doing good.

1261
01:41:27,432 --> 01:41:29,791
Press the comm. Say the mosque is clean.

1262
01:41:31,552 --> 01:41:32,872
Say it like us.

1263
01:41:34,752 --> 01:41:36,031
The mosque is clean.

1264
01:41:52,432 --> 01:41:54,072
You again?

1265
01:41:54,112 --> 01:41:56,272
I can't even die alone?

1266
01:41:56,311 --> 01:41:58,072
- Two.
- Two.

1267
01:41:58,831 --> 01:41:59,952
Two.

1268
01:42:00,991 --> 01:42:03,232
Baybars, where's my SMAW?!

1269
01:42:40,471 --> 01:42:42,031
Sweet roses blossom.

1270
01:42:42,072 --> 01:42:43,632
So the bees taste.

1271
01:42:45,712 --> 01:42:48,112
Roses pinned to chests.

1272
01:42:50,551 --> 01:42:52,312
To wither in time.

1273
01:43:04,591 --> 01:43:05,512
Arif.

1274
01:43:06,792 --> 01:43:08,832
Arif, get down!

1275
01:43:14,112 --> 01:43:15,112
Load up!

1276
01:43:17,232 --> 01:43:19,032
Arif, move!

1277
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:04,192
- Arif, come in, Arif.
- They are in the village, sir.

1278
01:44:04,231 --> 01:44:07,152
Arif, we need to head to the
Last Castle. Get down.

1279
01:45:03,391 --> 01:45:05,752
Sir. The flank is falling.

1280
01:45:06,952 --> 01:45:08,512
On our way, Baybars.

1281
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:21,151
Guys, fall back. We're right behind you!

1282
01:45:24,271 --> 01:45:26,791
Sir, I need to cover you.

1283
01:45:28,312 --> 01:45:30,112
- Mustafa.
- Sir.

1284
01:45:30,792 --> 01:45:34,711
The other day my son asked
"Dad are you a hero?".

1285
01:45:36,511 --> 01:45:37,831
What did you say?

1286
01:45:39,511 --> 01:45:40,752
I said I was not...

1287
01:45:41,791 --> 01:45:43,552
...but that I served under one.

1288
01:45:55,591 --> 01:45:56,911
Go!

1289
01:45:58,951 --> 01:46:00,791
Humans grow from the cradle.

1290
01:46:00,792 --> 01:46:02,832
To lie sleep in the grave.

1291
01:46:14,032 --> 01:46:15,112
Cover me!

1292
01:46:20,992 --> 01:46:22,671
Arif, how many do you see?

1293
01:46:22,672 --> 01:46:24,232
10 sir.

1294
01:46:26,352 --> 01:46:27,031
9.

1295
01:46:27,072 --> 01:46:30,031
Arif, you know my son, Rüzgar.

1296
01:46:31,231 --> 01:46:34,432
Of course I do sir. Handsome
like his dad.

1297
01:46:40,231 --> 01:46:42,031
Arif commander!

1298
01:46:55,992 --> 01:46:57,271
Boran!

1299
01:46:58,032 --> 01:47:00,472
- Hang in there buddy!
- I'm good, sir.

1300
01:47:19,351 --> 01:47:20,551
Rüzgar.

1301
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:23,791
He will be my ward, sir!

1302
01:47:30,631 --> 01:47:32,671
Heroes gladly fall.

1303
01:47:33,391 --> 01:47:34,991
To protect their homeland.

1304
01:47:34,992 --> 01:47:36,751
One dies,

1305
01:47:37,272 --> 01:47:39,391
a thousand rise!

1306
01:48:01,392 --> 01:48:02,712
Arif, sitrep.

1307
01:48:02,752 --> 01:48:04,231
Eşref here sir.

1308
01:48:04,552 --> 01:48:05,352
Boran...

1309
01:48:06,391 --> 01:48:08,352
- Boran what?
- He's critically wounded.

1310
01:48:08,392 --> 01:48:10,471
Get out of there now.

1311
01:48:16,992 --> 01:48:19,192
- Bring Arif and the others.
- Yes sir.

1312
01:48:21,432 --> 01:48:23,032
- Bekir?
- Huh?

1313
01:48:25,272 --> 01:48:26,310
Thanks.

1314
01:48:26,311 --> 01:48:27,792
What, why?

1315
01:48:27,832 --> 01:48:29,191
Just, thanks.

1316
01:48:31,072 --> 01:48:32,992
I ain't used to this, scrub.

1317
01:48:33,271 --> 01:48:36,072
I'd expect daft history lessons
from you.

1318
01:48:36,112 --> 01:48:38,032
Huns, Ithiopans, Hittites and stuff.

1319
01:48:38,071 --> 01:48:40,831
- Ethiopian.
- What?

1320
01:48:41,112 --> 01:48:42,592
They are called Ethiopians.

1321
01:48:44,992 --> 01:48:46,951
That's more fucking like it.

1322
01:48:46,992 --> 01:48:48,391
Let's go.

1323
01:49:43,591 --> 01:49:45,472
- Eşref!
- Eşref!

1324
01:49:46,591 --> 01:49:48,312
Eşref!

1325
01:49:50,272 --> 01:49:51,352
Eşref!

1326
01:49:56,071 --> 01:49:57,151
Don't.

1327
01:50:00,991 --> 01:50:02,311
Where'd it come from?

1328
01:50:02,551 --> 01:50:04,111
Shield.

1329
01:50:04,392 --> 01:50:05,311
What?

1330
01:50:05,592 --> 01:50:07,192
Make me your shield.

1331
01:50:07,432 --> 01:50:09,192
Eşref, I'm won't leave you here.

1332
01:50:09,592 --> 01:50:13,792
I can't feel my legs.
Use your head, Arif.

1333
01:50:16,111 --> 01:50:17,992
Make me your shield.

1334
01:50:20,032 --> 01:50:21,552
Come on.

1335
01:50:38,911 --> 01:50:41,352
4 o'clock.

1336
01:50:48,112 --> 01:50:50,512
Tell Sebahat.

1337
01:50:54,391 --> 01:50:56,272
I know, you'll find her.

1338
01:51:13,992 --> 01:51:15,871
Are you excited Bekir?

1339
01:51:16,111 --> 01:51:20,112
A little, sir, mostly because I get
to have a stubble after today.

1340
01:51:20,872 --> 01:51:23,671
You already know Baybars,
your classmate.

1341
01:51:23,952 --> 01:51:26,632
Everybody can do everything in MAK 8.

1342
01:51:26,671 --> 01:51:29,512
But we also have specialists among us.

1343
01:51:29,712 --> 01:51:32,752
Arif is our marksman,
Baybars will be heavy weapons.

1344
01:51:33,232 --> 01:51:35,311
Earman is infiltration.

1345
01:51:35,791 --> 01:51:37,752
Why do they say Earman?

1346
01:51:39,712 --> 01:51:43,192
If Eşref likes you, maybe one
day he'll tell the tale, Bekir.

1347
01:51:44,112 --> 01:51:46,192
Don't worry, nobody likes him.

1348
01:51:48,072 --> 01:51:49,711
Sir?

1349
01:51:49,992 --> 01:51:53,472
Why do we fold each other's parachutes?

1350
01:51:53,712 --> 01:51:55,351
So that you remember.

1351
01:51:55,552 --> 01:51:57,832
No man is responsible for himself only.

1352
01:51:58,231 --> 01:52:00,432
We always take care of each other first.

1353
01:52:03,391 --> 01:52:04,591
We ready?

1354
01:52:04,992 --> 01:52:06,472
Did you fold it properly?

1355
01:52:06,511 --> 01:52:09,151
Can't recall really.

1356
01:52:48,192 --> 01:52:49,312
Eşref?

1357
01:53:08,592 --> 01:53:10,711
Sir, they're encircling us.

1358
01:53:12,352 --> 01:53:14,472
Everybody load up.

1359
01:53:19,471 --> 01:53:20,992
Last!

1360
01:53:21,031 --> 01:53:22,072
Last.

1361
01:53:28,111 --> 01:53:28,872
Last.

1362
01:53:30,151 --> 01:53:32,872
Nabat, I'll help you to the shelter.

1363
01:53:34,032 --> 01:53:37,111
The battle makes the warrior, commander.

1364
01:55:11,592 --> 01:55:13,312
Oguz, wake up. Oguz!

1365
01:55:21,391 --> 01:55:22,912
Bekir!

1366
01:55:36,511 --> 01:55:39,232
One. One, two, three.

1367
01:57:03,712 --> 01:57:04,632
No!

1368
01:57:04,672 --> 01:57:06,031
Sir!

1369
01:57:33,712 --> 01:57:35,311
Sir.

1370
01:57:35,752 --> 01:57:37,351
Sir!

1371
01:58:26,191 --> 01:58:27,991
I had a daughter Ceyda.

1372
01:58:28,591 --> 01:58:31,792
If she had lived I'd want her to
be like you.

1373
01:58:32,152 --> 01:58:36,072
With heart, knowledge, defiance.

1374
01:58:39,271 --> 01:58:42,672
I'd want criticizing the country
and the military.

1375
01:58:42,712 --> 01:58:45,312
The state, and the people too.

1376
01:58:45,472 --> 01:58:48,472
I'd want her uncovering our faults.

1377
01:58:49,632 --> 01:58:51,432
Just as long as she had love.

1378
01:58:56,112 --> 01:58:59,032
Love for the country and all its faults.

1379
01:58:59,872 --> 01:59:02,191
If you want to honor us...

1380
01:59:03,631 --> 01:59:05,592
...just love, Ceyda.

1381
01:59:26,352 --> 01:59:27,991
Remember the good things...

1382
01:59:29,071 --> 01:59:31,072
...our banter...

1383
01:59:31,752 --> 01:59:35,472
...brotherhood and the laughter.

1384
01:59:37,272 --> 01:59:38,431
Remember the football match.

1385
01:59:41,311 --> 01:59:43,032
Bekir.

1386
01:59:43,392 --> 01:59:46,992
Tell them my last command was to
extract all remaining villagers.

1387
01:59:47,431 --> 01:59:49,272
They won't refuse.

1388
01:59:51,312 --> 01:59:52,792
Oguz.

1389
02:00:10,591 --> 02:00:12,151
Don't forget.

1390
02:00:13,432 --> 02:00:15,312
The reason...

1391
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:19,552
...don't forget it.

1392
02:00:55,672 --> 02:00:58,632
We've laid out all the plans
from HQ, sir.

1393
02:00:59,272 --> 02:01:01,471
Normally they ransom, but not now.

1394
02:01:01,831 --> 02:01:04,032
Ceyda put the yezidi on the news...

1395
02:01:04,231 --> 02:01:05,551
...they'll execute her.

1396
02:01:05,552 --> 02:01:09,472
It will take at least a week for them
to move south of Raqqa to the mountain.

1397
02:01:09,552 --> 02:01:11,872
We need to make good use of that week.

1398
02:01:13,312 --> 02:01:15,751
Why are we saving this woman?

1399
02:01:18,192 --> 02:01:21,432
She's a journalist who built
a career on criticizing us.

1400
02:01:25,272 --> 02:01:27,712
Being a Turk used to have some meaning.

1401
02:01:28,032 --> 02:01:31,072
- Still does, sir.
- Does it?

1402
02:01:31,992 --> 02:01:33,712
Does it, still?

1403
02:01:34,632 --> 02:01:37,551
They will behead a Turkish woman
and record it on camera.

1404
02:01:37,552 --> 02:01:39,352
The world will watch.

1405
02:01:44,791 --> 02:01:47,752
Beyond all duties, we soldiers
have a moral duty.

1406
02:01:48,072 --> 02:01:51,552
To put our life and our existence
on the line for the benefit...

1407
02:01:51,832 --> 02:01:55,072
...of all of our people, and stand
with them against any enemy.

1408
02:01:56,431 --> 02:01:58,192
She can hate us...

1409
02:01:58,232 --> 02:02:02,071
...or love us, makes no difference.
Our duty is absolute to our people.

1410
02:02:02,592 --> 02:02:04,471
That responsibility is why you exist.

1411
02:02:06,271 --> 02:02:09,072
It's why you're coming with us.

1412
02:02:09,912 --> 02:02:11,032
Gentlemen.

1413
02:02:11,791 --> 02:02:14,071
This is your first MAK 8 operation.

1414
02:02:30,271 --> 02:02:31,872
The time has come.

1415
02:02:32,112 --> 02:02:33,751
Indeed it has.

1416
02:02:36,472 --> 02:02:38,272
Time to let live.

1417
02:04:10,273 --> 02:04:17,273
Synced, corrected, and fixed by
H@w-to-kiLL @subscene.com.
-- WAIT ! THERE'S MORE -

1418
02:04:17,791 --> 02:04:18,991
Sir, through pass!

1419
02:04:19,471 --> 02:04:21,312
- Let do dammit.
- C'mon Oguz!

1420
02:04:21,912 --> 02:04:24,871
- Penalty!
- No it was nothing.

1421
02:04:26,352 --> 02:04:28,152
- What happened?
- Penalty.

1422
02:04:28,192 --> 02:04:29,591
What penalty sir?
Sheesh.

1423
02:04:29,592 --> 02:04:31,392
Bekir, don't offend a superior officer.

1424
02:04:31,432 --> 02:04:33,552
Aw sir, this here is
peer pressure from rank.

1425
02:04:33,592 --> 02:04:34,951
I used to be a civilian too!

1426
02:04:34,992 --> 02:04:37,752
Sir, you already gave us
this half-lame...

1427
02:04:38,352 --> 02:04:40,551
If you're all going whine,
let's stop playing.

1428
02:04:40,552 --> 02:04:41,991
You already have Baybars as keeper.

1429
02:04:41,992 --> 02:04:44,032
Aww, poor officers are sad.

1430
02:04:44,071 --> 02:04:46,032
It's alright sir. Win the game.

1431
02:04:51,352 --> 02:04:53,512
Get used to how officers are, Bekir.

1432
02:04:53,712 --> 02:04:56,512
They got the easy life.

1433
02:04:56,992 --> 02:04:59,352
- You too Brutus?
- Oh, didn't see you here, sir!

1434
02:04:59,791 --> 02:05:01,032
Well this has to stop.

1435
02:05:01,072 --> 02:05:03,991
I'm forming MAK 11.
NCOs only!

1436
02:05:04,231 --> 02:05:06,511
C'mon move!

1437
02:05:07,152 --> 02:05:09,031
